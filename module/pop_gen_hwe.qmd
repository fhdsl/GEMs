## Overview

This module uses the [All of Us Data Browser](https://databrowser.researchallofus.org/) to encourage critical thinking on ethical concepts in human genomics. 

**Duration:** 30 minutes - 1 hour.

## Learning Objectives

1.  Identify and critique scientific issues relating to society or ethics (see [GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/) core competencies).

2.  Interpret the ethical, legal, medical, and social implications of biological data (see [NIBLSE](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/niblse/core_competencies) core competencies).

## Prerequisites

Students will benefit from some awareness of genetically-based medical conditions and ethics in genomics. We suggest this activity could accompany lectures that discuss these topics. These ethics-related questions can also be added on to any activity that leverages the [All of Us Data Browser](https://databrowser.researchallofus.org/).

## Evaluation

GEMs is an NIH-funded program. Part of our mission is understanding the impact of our materials. Please take the time to review our program as an instructor after this activity. We also appreciate you distributing our survey to students before and after they participate in GEMs content.
