## Overview

This module uses the [PopGen Fishbowl simulator](https://virtualbiologylab.org/ModelsHTML5/PopGenFishbowl/PopGenFishbowl.html) to model natural selection and genetic drift, as well as explore whether populations are at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

**Duration:** 1 - 2 hours

## Learning Objectives

1.  Determine if a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

2.  Compare and contrast natural selection and genetic drift

3. Predict outcomes of interactions between genotypes and environmental pressures

## Prerequisites

Students will benefit from some awareness of basic evolutionary theory, particularly Mendelian inheritance, as well as the concepts of phenotypes, genotypes, and the relationship between the two. Students should also understand the concepts of genetic drift and natural selection.

## Evaluation

GEMs is an NIH-funded program. Part of our mission is understanding the impact of our materials. Please take the time to review our program as an instructor after this activity. We also appreciate you distributing our survey to students before and after they participate in GEMs content.
