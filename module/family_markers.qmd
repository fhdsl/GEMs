## Overview

This activity teaches students to interpret pedigree information and use bioinformatics tools (R) to build pedigrees for tracking disease traits in families. Students will work with real data from a bipolar disorder genetics study to understand how researchers understand risk genes using pedigrees.

**Duration:** Approximately 2-3 hours (depending on student familiarity with R)

## Learning Objectives

1.  Interpret pedigree information to determine the suitability of a DNA marker for tracking a disease trait in a family (see [GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/) learning objectives).

2.  Build a pedigree using bioinformatics tools (R).

## Materials and Setup

-   Students will need either:

    -   An internet connection for this activity as written (using Posit Cloud)
    -   A local installation of R or RStudio (with data downloaded and `kinship2` package installed ahead of time)

-   Required R package: `kinship2`

-   Data hosting: https://genomicseducation.org/data/pedigree_data.csv

-   Download the R student activity as:

## Scientific Topics

The activity is based a [published research study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01609-4) "Rare variants implicate NMDA receptor signaling and cerebellar gene networks in risk for bipolar disorder." Students will gain exposure to the following:

-   Bipolar Disorder: Neuropsychiatric condition affecting \~1% of population, with 10-25% risk for children of affected parents

-   Cerebellum: Brain region containing 50% of neurons despite being 10% of brain volume; involved in motor coordination and emotional regulation

-   NMDA Receptors: Glutamate receptors crucial for memory and learning; blocked by substances like alcohol and ketamine

-   DAO Gene: D-amino acid oxidase gene identified as significantly associated with bipolar disorder risk

## Outline

-   Part 1: Background and Setup (30-45 minutes)

-   Part 2: Basic Pedigree Construction (20-30 minutes)

-   Part 3: Adding Diagnostic Information (15-20 minutes)

-   Part 4: Genotype Mapping and Analysis (30-40 minutes)
