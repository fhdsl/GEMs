# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. This format allows you to combine written instructions with R code and output into a single file. The R code is embedded into the document and can be run step-by-step. 

Embedded R code chunks look like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

In order to make the code chunk run, you can click the green triangle in the upper right-hand corner of the code chunk. 

You can also click the button that says "Run" in the right-hand side of the toolbar just above this panel and choose which code (single lines, entire chunks, entire document) you'd like to run.

# Loading the tidyverse package and the data

All the additional datasets for this activity can be loaded into R from their URL. In order to do this, we will use some code that has been saved in an R package called `tidyverse`. In order to use this code, we will need to install and open `tidyverse` using the R code chunk below.

`install.packages` retrieves and installs the package

`library` opens the package and makes the stored code available for you to use

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)
```


Once you have installed and opened `tidyverse`, you should be ready to load the experimental data. You can do this using the `read_csv` command.

Let's say you want to open one of the differential expression datasets and call it `dat`. The command would be:

dat <- read_csv("URL where the dataset is stored")

Try it!

```{r}
dat <- read_csv("https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RoDiq_D1YHVinmbuLRHCoGQ2wS8eWbB2/view?usp=sharing")

```

# Analysis

Before starting this activity, you should have completed the miniCURE activities and identified genes of interest for your individual project.
Remember, the basic steps of your analysis are:

1. Examine expression of your  gene of interest expressed in this dataset.
2. Explore whether your gene of interest is differentially expressed in different experimental groups.
3. Characterize the genes that are differentially expressed between the experimental groups based on their molecular activity.

You can use this chunk to analyze your data! 

```{r}

```


# Code used in miniCURE exercises

Here's a quick overview of some of the code you used in the lab exercises!

##   Exploring the dataframe

This lets you explore how the dataset is formatted and how big it is

head(readCounts)
dim(readCounts)

## Summarizing count data

These commands allow you to run basic statistics on a variable (column) in the dataset

summary(readCounts$V2)
sum(readCounts$V2)

## Plotting a histogram

A general histogram:
hist(readCounts$V2, main="Read Counts for Drosophila RNA-seq sample")

A histogram with a log-transformed x-axis:
hist(log10(readCounts$V2), main="Log10 Read Counts for Drosophila RNA-seq sample")

A histogram with a log-transformed x-axis and corrected zeros:
hist(log10(readCounts$V2 + 0.1), main="Log10 Read Counts for Drosophila RNA-seq sample with Zero Correction")

## Filtering out a specific gene

You might want to look at the expression of a specific gene

filter(readCounts_Cu, V1=="FBgn0002522")
