## Background

### Polygenic Inheritance

### Polygenic Risk Scores
Most human diseases develop as a result of a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Researchers have developed something called a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) to estimate how likely a person might be to develop a disease based on their genetics.

::: reflection
It’s always important to remember that **having a higher PRS does not guarantee someone will get a disease.**  Likewise, having a lower PRS does not guarantee someone is protected from a disease. 

A PRS is just a rough estimate based on what we know at the moment about the genetics that contribute to developing a disease. In many case, a high PRS will only increase a person's overall risk for a disease by less than 5%.
:::

At its core, the polygenic risk score is a simple idea. If multiple variants can contribute to the development of a disease, other variants might also provide protection from a disease. We can look at all the variants a person might have, add them up, and then get an idea of whether they have more variants that contribute to a disease relative to how many protective variants they have.
