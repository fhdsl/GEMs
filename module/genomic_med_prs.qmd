## Background

Many human diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. For most of these diseases, it can be difficult to predict what combination will lead to a person developing disease. Instead, physicians and researchers talk about the increased risk - essentially, we know what factors increase the likelihood of developing diseases, even if we can't predict with 100% certainty whether someone might get sick. 

### Polygenic Inheritance



### Polygenic Risk Scores
Researchers have developed something called a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) to estimate how likely a person might be to develop a disease based on their genetics.

::: reflection
It’s always important to remember that **having a higher PRS does not guarantee someone will get a disease.**  Likewise, having a lower PRS does not guarantee someone is protected from a disease. 

A PRS is just a rough estimate based on what we know at the moment about the genetics that contribute to developing a disease. In many case, a high PRS will only increase a person's overall risk for a disease by less than 5%.
:::

At its core, the polygenic risk score is a simple idea. If multiple variants can contribute to the development of a disease, other variants might also provide protection from a disease. We can look at all the variants a person might have, add them up, and then get an idea of whether they have more variants that contribute to a disease relative to how many protective variants they have.
