## Overview

This activity will walk through how to use a polygenic risk score (PRS) calculator, as well as how to interpret the outcome. Students will also compare calculations using different superpopulations, demonstrating the importance of diverse ancestry in PRS interpretation. 

**Duration:** Approximately 2-3 hours

## Learning Objectives

1. Calculate and interpret polygenic risk scores.

2. Compare risk percentiles using different ancestral superpopulations.

3. Identify and critique scientific issues relating to society or ethics (see [GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/) core competencies).
