## Overview

This activity will walk through how to use an online polygenic risk score (PRS) calculator, as well as how to interpret the outcome. Students will compare calculations using different studies, demonstrating the importance of study selection and ancestry in PRS interpretation.

**Duration:** Approximately 1.5-2 hours

## Learning Objectives

1.  Differentiate between Mendelian and polygenic traits.

2.  Explore variants and studies through an online database (EMBL-EBI).

3.  Calculate and interpret polygenic risk scores.

4.  Compare risk percentiles using studies that were conducted using cases and controls from different ancestral populations.

5.  Identify and critique scientific issues relating to society or ethics (see [GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/) core competencies).
