## Overview

This module introduces students to differential expression analyses using the R programming language. Previous programming experience is helpful but not necessary. Students will work with real data from a mouse RNA-seq study to explore how the gut-brain axis might impact symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

This module is a companion and expansion to the C-MOOR RNA-seq miniCURE. **It can be used as a stand-alone activity or as part of a broader miniCURE experience.** Students do not have to have completed the miniCURE in order to use the stand-alone guide. If you are using the RNA-seq miniCURE in your class, this module adds an additional RNA-seq dataset that is suitable for an independent research project.

You can find out more about the RNA-seq miniCURE and other C-MOOR activities at the [C-MOOR website](https://www.c-moor.org/). An online guide to the miniCURE is [here](https://science.c-moor.org/miniCURE-RNA-seq/index.html).

**Duration:** 

## Learning Objectives

1.  Explore differential expression data in mice.

2.  Identify genes that are differentially expressed in an RNA-seq dataset.

3. (Optional) Formulate and test a hypothesis about differential expression of genes as a result of the gut-brain axis.

## Materials and Setup

-   Students will need either:

    -   An internet connection for this activity as written (using Posit Cloud)
    -   A local installation of R or RStudio (with data downloaded and `tidyverse` package installed ahead of time)

-   Required R package: `tidyverse`
 
-   Data hosting:

## Scientific Topics

The activity uses data from a [published research study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30502-1) "Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice" [@sharon2019]. Students will gain exposure to the following:

-   Differential expression: the process where different cells within an organism, even those with the same DNA, express different genes, with some genes being expressed or "turned on", while others are "turned off"

-   Gut-brain axis: the proposed connection between the gut microbiome and gene expression in the brain

-   Autism Spectrum Disorder: a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions

-   Prefrontal cortex: the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions

-   Striatum: the part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions
