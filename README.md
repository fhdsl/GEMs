# ðŸ’Ž GEMs Program

This is the main repository for the Genomics Education Modules (GEMs) Program, a collaborative project between [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) and community college faculty partners.

Our team focuses specifically on [genomic data science](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Genomic-Data-Science), an interdisciplinary field that combines both biology and computational skills. Here, you will be able to find links to our modules to use in the classroom or workplace.

Find out more about us and download resources on [our website](https://genomicseducation.org/). GEMs is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute [1R25HG013489](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/SjWuEKrSVEGVaHvRb9L-vg/project-details/10854368).
