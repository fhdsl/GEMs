Previous programming experience is helpful but not necessary. Students will work with real data from a mouse RNA-seq study to explore how the gut-brain axis might impact symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nThis module is a companion and expansion to the C-MOOR RNA-seq miniCURE. This module adds an additional RNA-seq dataset that is suitable for an independent research project.\n\nYou can find out more about the RNA-seq miniCURE and other C-MOOR activities at the [C-MOOR website](https://www.c-moor.org/). An online guide to the miniCURE is [here](https://science.c-moor.org/miniCURE-RNA-seq/index.html).\n\n**Duration:** Three lab periods\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n1.  Explore differential expression data in mice.\n\n2.  Identify genes that are differentially expressed in an RNA-seq dataset.\n\n3.
