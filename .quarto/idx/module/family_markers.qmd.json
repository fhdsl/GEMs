Students will work with real data from a bipolar disorder genetics study to understand how researchers understand risk genes using pedigrees.\n\n**Duration:** Approximately 2-3 hours (depending on student familiarity with R)\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n1.  Interpret pedigree information to determine the suitability of a DNA marker for tracking a disease trait in a family (see [GSA](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/) learning objectives).\n\n2.  Build a pedigree using bioinformatics tools (R).\n\n## Materials and Setup\n\n-   Students will need either:\n\n    -   An internet connection for this activity as written (using Posit Cloud)\n    -   A local installation of R or RStudio (with data downloaded and `kinship2` package installed ahead of time)\n\n-   Required R package: `kinship2`\n\n-   Data hosting: https://genomicseducation.org/data/pedigree_data.csv\n\n-   Download the R student activity as:\n\n    -   [Web page](https://genomicseducation.org/module/family_markers_student_guide.html)\n    -   [Quarto (qmd)](https://github.com/fhdsl/GEMs/blob/main/module/family_markers_student_guide.qmd)\n    -   [Word (docx)](https://github.com/fhdsl/GEMs/raw/main/docs/docx/module/family_markers_student_guide.docx)\n    -   [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBGugINV2mOrq-knq5MXPOC-WcQSxnMA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116032995747974603894&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n-   Google Slides presentation available for borrowing images [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dhP4CeUIJAqy3z7mKxuFzk8b8LhLrPBPHb1bpYpbk3c/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n-   Answer key available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KcX30s2fYzFw16boGVO4MlhSAA2Pr3OzqwmndeO043U/edit?usp=sharing).
