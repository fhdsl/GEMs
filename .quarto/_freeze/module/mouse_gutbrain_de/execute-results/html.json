Previous programming experience is helpful but not necessary. Students will work with real data from a mouse RNA-seq study to explore how the gut-brain axis might impact symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nThis module is a companion and expansion to the C-MOOR RNA-seq miniCURE. This module adds an additional RNA-seq dataset that is suitable for an independent research project.\n\nYou can find out more about the RNA-seq miniCURE and other C-MOOR activities at the [C-MOOR website](https://www.c-moor.org/). An online guide to the miniCURE is [here](https://science.c-moor.org/miniCURE-RNA-seq/index.html).\n\n**Duration:** Three lab periods\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n1.  Explore differential expression data in mice.\n\n2.  Identify genes that are differentially expressed in an RNA-seq dataset.\n\n3. (Optional) Formulate and test a hypothesis about differential expression of genes as a result of the gut-brain axis.\n\n## Materials and Setup\n\n-   Students will need either:\n\n    -   An internet connection for this activity as written (using Posit Cloud)\n    -   A local installation of R or RStudio (with data downloaded and `tidyverse` package installed ahead of time)\n\n-   Required R package: `tidyverse`\n \n-   Data hosting:\n\n    -   [Comparing gene expression between ASD and control mice, both brain regions](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol.csv)\n    -   [Comparing gene expression between ASD and control mice, prefrontal cortex only](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv)\n     -   [Comparing gene expression between ASD and control mice, striatum only](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv)\n     -   [Comparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum, all mice](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype.csv)\n     -   [Comparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum, only ASD mice](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype_in_ASDmice.csv)\n     -   [Comparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum, only control mice](https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype_in_controlmice.csv)\n\n\n\n-   Download the R student activity as:\n\n    -   [Web page](https://genomicseducation.org/module/mouse_gutbrain_de_miniCURE_guide.html)\n    -   [Quarto (qmd)](https://github.com/fhdsl/GEMs/blob/main/module/mouse_gutbrain_de_miniCURE_guide.qmd)\n    -   [Word (docx)](https://github.com/fhdsl/GEMs/raw/main/docs/docx/module/mouse_gutbrain_de_miniCURE_guide.docx)\n    -   [Google Doc]() - coming soon!\n\n\n-   Google Slides presentation available for borrowing images [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vikcyml6uw-_DaC1yFpS-UWoWNEGxFukMB_eCi42BqY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n-   Answer key coming soon!\n\n## Scientific Topics\n\nThe activity uses data from a [published research study](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30502-1) \"Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice\" [@sharon2019]. Students will gain exposure to the following:\n\n-   Differential expression: the process where different cells within an organism, even those with the same DNA, express different genes, with some genes being expressed or \"turned on\", while others are \"turned off\"\n\n-   Gut-brain axis: the proposed connection between the gut microbiome and gene expression in the brain\n\n-   Autism Spectrum Disorder: a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions\n\n-   Prefrontal cortex: the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions\n\n-   Striatum: the part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions\n\n\n\n## Outline for RNA-seq miniCURE Extension \n\n-   Background and Setup\n\n-   Developing a Hypothesis; Identifying Genes of Interest\n\n-   Exploring Gene Expression Data\n\n-   Analyzing Differential Expression Data\n",
