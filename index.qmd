### **About**  

Welcome! This is the main website for the Genomics Education Modules (GEMs) Program, a collaborative project between [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html), [Clovis Community College](https://www.cloviscollege.edu/), [Guttman Community College](https://guttman.cuny.edu/), and [Northern Virginia Community College](https://www.nvcc.edu/).

Our team focuses specifically on [genomic data science](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Genomic-Data-Science), an interdisciplinary field that combines both biology and computational skills. Here, you will be able to find links to our modules to use in the classroom or workplace.
