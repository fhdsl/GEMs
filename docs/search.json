    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\n\nBackground\nFirst, let’s read the “plain language” summary from a publication entitled “Rare variants implicate NMDA receptor signaling and cerebellar gene networks in risk for bipolar disorder”.\n\nThis research explores the genetic basis of bipolar disorder, a serious mental health condition where people experience extreme mood swings between mania and depression. The researchers studied DNA from 41 families with multiple members affected by bipolar disorder. They identified 741 genes potentially linked to bipolar disorder, which overlapped with genes known to be involved in other brain development disorders. Their most significant finding was a specific variant in a gene called DAO (D-amino acid oxidase). When they tested this variant in human cells, it reduced the amount and activity of the DAO protein. In mice with the equivalent genetic change, they observed: (1) less DAO protein in certain brain regions, (2) greater susceptibility to stress, (3) altered responses to drugs affecting NMDAR (a type of brain receptor), and (4) changes in gene activity patterns in the cerebellum (a brain region). The team also found similar gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of human bipolar disorder patients. The study suggests bipolar disorder may involve disruptions to NMDAR signaling and gene expression in the cerebellum, providing new insights into how this condition develops at the molecular level.\n\nAs the researchers mentioned in their summary, bipolar disorder is neuropsychiatric disorder that affects moods. “Neuropsychiatric” means that it involves both the structure of the brain and mental health. People with bipolar disorder may experience “low” periods of intense sadness, low energy, low motivation, and loss of interest in daily activities, as well as “high periods” of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and potentially hallucinations or an altered sense of reality. While everyone will experience mood swings, in people with bipolar disorder these swings are more extreme and may last for weeks. Bipolar disorder is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the risk of developing bipolar disorder is about 1% for the general public. For someone who has a parent with bipolar disorder, this risk is between 10% and 25%. Interestingly, people who have a parent with schizophrenia also have an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder compared to the general population, which suggests there may be a shared genetic basis to both disorders (as well as with major depression).\nThe cerebellum is the region of the brain located just above the spinal cord. Size-wise, it’s about 10% of the brain, but it contains roughly 50% of the neurons. Scientists started noticing more than 200 years ago that people with cerebellum injuries frequently had difficulty maintaining their balance (either while standing or while walking), as well as difficulty with judging how far to reach when picking up objects. People with these types of injuries may also have difficulty judging how far objects are, learning new motor skills, or keeping consistent timing when tapping their fingers. The cerebellum essentially coordinates motor movement and gait, maintains posture and balance, and controls muscle tone (the amount of tension in the muscle) and voluntary muscle activity. More recently, scientists have discovered that the cerebellum also plays a role in attention, language, and regulating emotional responses like fear and pleasure, though the specific details on how are still under investigation.\nNMDA receptors (NMDAR), or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, are a type of glutamate receptor in the brain. When an NMDAR binds both glutamate and glycine, it opens a channel that allows positively charged ions (like calcium ions) to flow into the neuron. The movement of calcium ions through NMDARs is thought to be particularly important for memory and learning. Drugs such as alcohol, PCP, ketamine, and nitrous oxide block NMDAR activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the DAO gene do?\nHow did researchers identify DAO and other possible genes linked to bipolar disorder?\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will construct a pedigree from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename your project “Family Markers” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the kinship2 package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"kinship2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(kinship2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\n\n\n\n\nGet Pedigree Data\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nped_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/pedigree_data.csv\")\nped_data\n\n   ped id father mother sex bipolar depression diagnosis_available DAO IL6\n1    1  1      0      0   1      NA         NA                   0        \n2    1  2      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n3    1  3      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n4    1  4      1      2   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n5    1  5      1      2   2      NA         NA                   0        \n6    1  6      1      2   1      NA         NA                   0        \n7    1  7      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n8    1  8      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n9    1  9      4      3   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n10   1 10      4      3   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/V\n11   1 11      4      3   1       0          1                   1        \n12   1 12      4      3   2      NA         NA                   0        \n13   1 13      0      0   1       0          0                   1        \n14   1 14      6      7   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n15   1 15      9      8   2      NA         NA                   0        \n16   1 16      9      8   1       0          1                   1        \n17   1 17      9      8   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/+\n18   1 18     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n19   1 19     13     12   2       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n20   1 20     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n\n\nIf everything went correctly, you should see both an object called ped_data in the Environment Pane (top right) and the data printed to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an R object?\n\n\n\nAn object is something stored in a programming language, such as data. Think of it like a “noun”.\nIn R, we assign objects using the &lt;- symbol, with the name of your choice on the left, and the contents of the object on the right.\nObjects will show up in your Environment Pane. It’s a good idea to check the Environment Pane regularly.\n\n\nEnter the following code in the console to view the data in tabular format:\n\nView(ped_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionaries\nTake a look at the column names.

    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over the background and data for this activity.\nMany human diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. For most of these diseases, it can be difficult to predict what combination will lead to a person developing disease. Instead, physicians and researchers talk about the increased risk - essentially, we know what factors increase the likelihood of developing diseases, even if we can’t predict with 100% certainty whether someone might get sick.\n\nPolygenic Inheritance\nWhen we think about genetically-inherited diseases, we usually think about those where a single gene variant can cause disease. Most of the classic examples of genetic disease, like sickle cell anemia, Tay Sachs, or Huntington’s, are passed along via Mendelian inheritance. A mutation in a single gene is enough to disrupt normal protein synthesis and cellular processes, causing a person to become sick.\n\nHowever, most diseases, particularly common diseases, are not the result of a mutation to a single gene. Instead, they are the result of mutations to many different genes. Each mutation itself isn’t enough to cause problems, but when all of them show up together, the cellular processes aren’t able to function normally. This type of inheritance (when a trait is caused by a combination of mutations to many genes) is called polygenic inheritance. Polygenic traits are quite common, and they aren’t always diseases! Any trait that shows a range of phenotypes is likely to be the result of polygenic inheritance. Some of the more famous polygenic traits include height and skin color.\n\n\nPolygenic Risk Scores\nResearchers have developed something called a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) to estimate how likely a person might be to develop a disease based on their genetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Risk\n\n\n\nIt’s always important to remember that having a higher PRS does not guarantee someone will get a disease. Likewise, having a lower PRS does not guarantee someone is protected from a disease.\nA PRS is just a rough estimate based on what we know at the moment about the genetics that contribute to developing a disease. In many case, a high PRS will only increase a person’s overall risk for a disease by less than 5%.\n\n\nAt its core, the polygenic risk score is a simple idea. If multiple variants can contribute to the development of a disease, other variants might also provide protection from a disease. We can look at all the variants a person might have, add them up, and then get an idea of whether they have more variants that contribute to a disease relative to how many protective variants they have.\nBeing able to calculate a PRS requires that scientists have an understanding of all the genes and noncoding regions of DNA that might contribute to developing (or not developing) a disease. A PRS is only as good as the reference database for a particular disease or trait.\n\n\nGenomic Ancestry\n\n\n\nExploring Variant Data\nIn the next steps, we’ll be looking at how PRS can help patients be more informed about disease risk.\nThis example will look at prostate carcinoma, or prostate cancer. While prostate cancer is common in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related death, it tends to be slow growing with limited aggressiveness (see this source). This means that genetic screening and symptom monitoring, especially in older age, can have a big impact on outcomes.\n\n\nMr. J’s Data\nWe’re going to take gene screening data from an imaginary patient, Mr. J, to understand his risk. Mr. J has African ancestry, which will be important later.\nGet the data at https://genomicseducation.org/data/prs_ind_1.txt. It should look like:\nrs7463326:G\nrs58235267:G\nrs74001374:C\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the data mean?\n\n\n\nEach line of the data represents a variant location in the genome and individual person’s version of that gene (allele).\nFor example, rs7463326 is the variant. Mr. J has a “G” here. Other patients might have “A” or “C”.\n\n\n\n\nExploring Variants\nLet’s explore the rs7463326 variant a bit more. Go to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/variants and type “rs7463326” in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the first result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the variant information. The most severe rs7463326 variant lies in an intergenic region, or between protein coding genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to see the risk allele associated with the variant. For rs7463326, the risk allele is “G” and it’s associated with prostate carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. J has a “G” here. Other patients might have “A” or “C”. This means he might be more at risk than other patients. However, we know risk is often dictated by multiple genes. In the next steps we’ll explore how to assess risk with multiple variants."

Copy this data into the top part of the PRS calculator website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the Study\nNext, scroll down to “GWAS Summary Statistics”. For item #1, “Select Disease(s) or Trait(s) of Interest”, type in “prostate carcinoma” and select the checkbox. You might need to type slowly as the dropdown list has a lot of options! Then, click on “Apply Filters” to update the studies that can be used to calculate the PRS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder “Select from Filtered Studies”, type in the study number, “GCST011047”, or find it from the dropdown menu. You will also see the name of the study, Conti et al. 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy a Specific Research Study?\n\n\n\nIn order to be accurate, PRS scores must be calculated based on the right variants. Variants should be collected from the same ancestral population as the patient. This is because some alleles are more rare in specific human ancestries and can confer different amount of risk / protection.\nMr. J’s variant data was carefully collected based on the variants identified in the Conti study (GCST011047).\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the Population\nSelect “African” as the “Preferred Super Population” and “1000 Genomes - AFR population” under “MAF Population”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, click “Calculate Risk Scores”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the Score\nThe calculated score for this study will appear in the box at the bottom. You will have to scroll over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Results\n\n\n\nIt might be easier to view the results if you (1) download the results and (2) open the results in a tabular data program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.\n\n\nLet’s review a few important values in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNP Overlap: This tells us how many variants in the patient’s data were also present in the study. 19 of Mr. J’s variants matched the Conti study.\nIncluded SNPs: This tells us how many variants were in the study overall. Mr. J’s data was comprehensive and included all of the 19 variants described in the Conti study. We can feel confident that there is not a lot of missing data.\nPolygenic Risk Score: Risk estimate based on all of Mr. J’s variants. Because the score is greater than 1, generally that means some increased risk.\nPercentile: Risk described relative to others in the population. A percentile of 100 means that Mr. J has greater risk than almost everyone else! He has more of the disease causing variants compared to others in the population."

A percentile of 82 means that Mr. J has greater risk than 82% of other people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapturing More Variants\n\n\n\nA mismatch between the study population and the patient’s ancestry can create gaps in PRS analysis. Many early studies were performed on genomes of people of European ancestry. This means that more reliable data is present for people of European ancestry. In other words, their variants are better known. People of African or East Asian ancestry don’t always had variant data that is as comprehensive. This means it’s more likely to end up in the situation above, where we can’t reliably calculate PRS.\nScientists realized recently that this was a problem. Programs like All of Us aim to collect better data on people from diverse backgrounds to improve PRS. Technology improvements have also made it more affordable to screen for more variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Eeles (GCST000152) study page and look at the description under “Discovery ancestry label”. What ancestry is included?\nGiven that Mr. J has African ancestry, which study (Conti or Eeles) is a more appropriate match to assess his risk?\nImagine you were helping Mr. J’s providers craft a care plan. Based on Mr. J’s results, would you recommend more frequent screening? Why or why not?"

    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. Researchers then bred the mice and looked for differences in gene expression in the brains of the offspring.\n\nBackground\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Although ASD can be diagnosed at any age, it’s considered a neurodevelopmental disorder because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems.\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\nThe original study\nThe original study, Gut Microbiota from Human Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\nThe mouse as a model organism\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models (https://www.cshl.edu/of-mice-and-model-organisms/, https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes).\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? Well, first, they’re economical and relatively easy to keep. Since mice are small, they don’t require a huge amount of space or food. They also have fast reproductive cycles, so researchers can study multiple generations within only a few years. Most importantly, though, mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases. They are particularly important model organisms for cancer research and neuroscience.\nYou can find additional information about how the mouse is used in research here!\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will explore the data from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity.

It’s one of several databases like this. Others include NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; the organization that manages GenBank and PubMed) and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. When a gene code starts with “ENS”, it means you should look up the gene code in the Ensembl database.\nMUS stands for “Mus”, which is the genus for the mouse.\nG stands for “Gene”. When you see “G” in the ID name, you know you are working with a gene. There are also codes for transcripts (“T”), exons (“E”), and proteins (“P”).\n00000000001 is the numerical code associated with the gene.\n\nRanking the genes by log2FoldChange\nThe log2FoldChange value gives us an idea of which genes show the greatest differential expression between the ASD mice and the control mice. We can arrange the table based on these values (going from smallest to largest) by copying the following code into your console:\n\nprefrontal_ascending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, log2FoldChange)\nhead(prefrontal_ascending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE   stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000080716     25.4          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  6.05e-31 3.64e-27\n2 ENSMUSG00000111968     25.0          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  5.79e-31 3.64e-27\n3 ENSMUSG00000090303     23.2          -25.1  1.92 -13.1  3.75e-39 1.36e-34\n4 ENSMUSG00000062818     21.2          -25.0  2.36 -10.6  3.54e-26 1.07e-22\n5 ENSMUSG00000101734     20.2          -24.9  2.06 -12.1  8.68e-34 1.04e-29\n6 ENSMUSG00000110465     20.0          -24.9  2.56  -9.72 2.57e-22 3.31e-19\n\n\nWe can use a similar command to look at the genes with the largest positive log2FoldChange.\n\nprefrontal_descending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, desc(log2FoldChange))\nhead(prefrontal_descending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000113093     17.0           24.6  2.93  8.37 5.63e-17 2.86e-14\n2 ENSMUSG00000112524     15.3           24.4  2.70  9.05 1.44e-19 1.06e-16\n3 ENSMUSG00000069301     13.9           24.3  2.73  8.91 5.30e-19 3.36e-16\n4 ENSMUSG00000104341     12.5           24.1  2.93  8.23 1.88e-16 9.06e-14\n5 ENSMUSG00000073974     15.0           24.1  2.70  8.92 4.87e-19 3.14e-16\n6 ENSMUSG00000054136     11.9           24.1  2.50  9.61 7.22e-22 7.66e-19\n\n\nTODO: Add details about positive vs negative values, ask students to identify which ones have the greatest log2FoldChange\n\n\nUsing the Mouse Genome Database\nWe have identified the genes (by their geneID) that show the greatest differential expression between ASD and control mice. Now let’s find out what those genes do!\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. (An Open Reading Frame, or ORF, is a stretch of DNA between a start codon and a stop codon that can be translated into a protein.) Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: Add questions that have students look information up on MGI. Add more MGI information on reg3a"

    "text": "Analysis\nBefore starting this activity, you should have completed the miniCURE activities and identified genes of interest for your individual project. Remember, the basic steps of your analysis are:\n\nExamine expression of your gene of interest expressed in this dataset.\nExplore whether your gene of interest is differentially expressed in different experimental groups.\nCharacterize the genes that are differentially expressed between the experimental groups based on their molecular activity.\n\nBelow, we’ve included a cheatsheet of some of the analysis steps you might want to do and the R code that helps you do it.\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will explore the data from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\nTODO: Add figure\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\nTODO: Add figure\nRename your project “Differential Expression ASD” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTODO: Add figure\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “tidyverse” package that you loaded is useful for loading, wrangling, and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the data\nYou have the option to look at gene expression in control vs ASD mice, as well as gene expression in both striatum and prefrontal cortex. All the mice were male and sacrificed at the same age (45 days).\nAdditionally, you can look at gene expression in striatum vs prefrontal cortex in only ASD mice or only control mice. Likewise, you also have the option of looking at gene expression in ASD and control mice, focusing only on striatum or only on prefrontal cortex.\nLet’s say you want to open the dataset that compares gene expression between ASD and control mice in both brain regions and call it asd_vs_c. We will do this using read_csv. Copy and paste this command into your console:\n\nasd_vs_c &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nHere are the URLs for all the possible comparisons you can examine with this dataset:\nComparing gene expression between ASD and control mice\nBoth brain regions: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol.csv\nPrefrontal cortex only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\nStriatum only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv\nComparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum\nAll mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype.csv\nOnly ASD mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype_in_ASDmice.csv\nOnly control mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype_in_controlmice.csv\n\n\nArranging dataset based on padj\nYou’re mostly interested in identifying the genes that have been differentially expressed between your two groups (in this case, ASD mouse brains and control mouse brains).

A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Clicking on the blue squares takes you to a page with more information about how that particular gene was assigned to a pathway or molecular process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare differential gene expression across regions\nIt might be interesting to look at the expression of a gene across all the possible regions. To do this, we will first load the region-specific datasets.\n\nasd_vs_c_prefrontal &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nasd_vs_c_striatum &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThen we’ll filter out the gene in which we’re interested from each object. Let’s take a look at gene ENSMUSG00000079516, which is the reg3a gene we previously looked up on MGI.\n\nreg3a_prefrontal &lt;- filter(asd_vs_c_prefrontal, gene == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\")\n\nreg3a_striatum &lt;- filter(asd_vs_c_striatum, gene == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\")\n\nFinally, take a look at the differential expression of reg3a in each region.\nIn the prefrontal cortex:\n\nreg3a_prefrontal\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000079516     10.6          -22.6  2.11 -10.7 7.30e-27 2.63e-23\n\n\nIn the striatum:\n\nreg3a_striatum\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat pvalue  padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000079516    0.371           2.27  2.96 0.765  0.444    NA\n\n\n\n\nPlotting a single gene across regions\n\nTODO: Figure out the bespoke function `PlotAcrossRegions`\nplotAcrossRegions(\"FBgn0000003\")\nENSMUSG00000079516\n\n\n\nRunning a gene set analysis\nYou can use the special command runClusterProfiler to figure out the types of processes genes on your gene list are involved in. You can also create a dotplot to visualize your results.\n\nTODO: Verify if `runClusterProfiler` is a bespoke function\n\nasd_vs_c_clusters &lt;- runClusterProfiler(asd_vs_c_sig)\n\ndotplot(asd_vs_c_clusters, showCategory=34, title=\"a1 vs p1\", font.size=10, label_format = 50)\n\nEXTRA UNNEEDED CODE (possibly needed to replace a bespoke function to create a plot across regions): Since we’re working with two separate datasets, let’s add a column to each dataset so we know whether we’re looking at expression data in prefrontal cortex or striatum.\n\nasd_vs_c_prefrontal$region &lt;- \"prefrontal_cortex\"\n\nasd_vs_c_striatum$region &lt;- \"striatum\"\n\nIf you take a look at both asd_vs_c_prefrontal and asd_vs_c_striatum, you’ll see that the new column has been added on the rightmost side of the data.\n\nhead(asd_vs_c_prefrontal)\nhead(asd_vs_c_striatum)\n\nNext, we’ll combine our two filtered datasets to make one single dataset that only contains expression of the reg3a gene. We’ll combine the datasets with the bind_rows. This command essentially “glues” the two datasets together, one on top of the other.\n\nreg3a &lt;- bind_rows(reg3a_prefrontal, reg3a_striatum)\nhead(reg3a)"

    "text": "The original study\nThe original study, Gut Microbiota from Human Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\nYou can read the original research paper here."

It is maintained by a consortium of Drosophila researchers and computer scientists at Harvard University, University of Cambridge (UK), Indiana University, and the University of New Mexico.\nFirst, open the FlyBase website by clicking the link or typing “https://flybase.org” into your browser. Then, type the name of the gene into the “J2G” bar in the upper right hand corner. (J2G stands for “Jump to Gene”.) As an example, try typing the gene name pipe and click enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene page for pipe will load. On the top of the page, you will see the general information about this gene, including the FlyBase gene ID and a brief description of what this gene does.\nBelow this general information section, the genomic location data will appear. There are several different ways gene locations might be recorded; for our purposes, we’re interested in the sequence location. The pipe gene is located. “3L” means this gene is on the left arm of the third chromosome. The numbers after 3L refer to the nucleotide location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can scroll down the page or click the menu on the right-hand side to move to additional sections. The next section we’re interested in is the function section. Here, we can see what the general molecular function of the gene is, what sorts of biological processes the gene product (the protein) is involved in, and where the protein is found in the cell, or the cellular component. In the case of pipe, we can see that it’s an enzyme involved in development, gene expression, protein metabolism. We also see that the pipe protein is found in the membrane and endomembrane system, as well as in the nucleus around the chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrolling down further takes us to a section with more details about the gene function. You may need to click on the small plus sign to view the details (or click on the minus sign to hide the details). We can see that pipe codes for an enzyme that is enables endopeptidase activator activity and protein binding.\nNow it’s your turn to look up your four genes in FlyBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK ONE\n\n\n\nFor each gene (scarlet, plum, mustard, and white), find the following information:\n\nFlyBase gene ID\nchromosomal location\nmolecular function\nthe biological processes the gene product is involved in\nwhere in the cell the gene product can be found"

    "section": "Part 2",
    "text": "Part 2\nNext, let’s explore additional genomic databases beyond FlyBase to characterize the homologs and orthologs to the four Drosophila genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA homolog is a gene or protein that is similar to another due to having a common evolutionary origin. Many genes in Drosophila have homologs in the human genome, as well as in the genomes of common model organisms like mice and zebrafish.\nAn ortholog is another term for a gene or protein that is similar due to having a common evolutionary origin, but in order to be an ortholog, the two genes must also have similar functions within the different species. An ortholog is a specialized kind of homolog.\nGenomic databases will report both homologs and orthologs.\n\n\nFirst, we need to find out what the name of the homologous genes are. The gene IDs and common names differ between species. If we keep scrolling down the page on the pipe gene in FlyBase, we can find what those homologous genes are called in our species of interest.\nIt turns out that the human gene most likely to be a homolog of pipe is called UST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we scroll down a little farther, we see that the most likely homologous mouse (Mus musculus) is called Ust. In the zebrafish (Danio rerio), it is most likely to be usta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find out more information about these homologs, we’re going to need to look at additional species-specific databases. Let’s start with the mouse.\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database is the international database for the laboratory mouse, integrating genetic, genomic, and biological data as part of an effort to use the mouse to study human health and disease. It is maintained by the Jackson Laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we have a database devoted to the mouse?\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models (https://www.cshl.edu/of-mice-and-model-organisms/, https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes).\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? One reason is that mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases.\n\n\nOpen the MGI database and search for the name of the mouse homolog Ust. You can do this either by typing Ust into the search bar and clicking “Quick Search” or by doing a topic specific search with the “Genes” toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “Genome Features” summary table should open up with information about Ust. MGI tells us that Ust is a protein-coding gene on chromosome 10. Clicking on the highlighted gene symbol will take us to a page with more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kinds of information you found in FlyBase will also be present on the detailed gene page in MGI. The information is organized into sections, similar to what you’ve already experienced with FlyBase. The fourth section down includes information about the human ortholog to Ust - it turns out to be UST, which we already knew from FlyBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarther down the page is a section called “Gene Ontology (GO) Classifications”. This is the section that has information about the molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components for Ust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Gene ontology” is a bioinformatics initiative focused on standardizing the vocabulary and annotations researchers use to describe genes, proteins, and data about gene and protein function. This effort allows us to more easily make comparisons about homologous and orthologous genes and proteins across species.\n\n\nIn mice, Ust is a tranferase (an enzyme!) involved in carbohydrate derivative binding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to look up information about the zebrafish homolog, we need to switch databases again.\nThe ZFIN (Zebrafish Information Network  is the database of genetic and genomic data for the zebrafish as a model organism. It was formed by a group of zebrafish researchers at Cold Spring Harbor and is maintained by the ZFIN Database Team at the University of Oregon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we have a database devoted to the zebrafish?\nZebrafish are a popular model organism for researchers who focus on developmental biology, genetics, and modeling diseases. They develop rapidly and have high fertility, so it can be relatively quick and fast to study the effects of genes or diseases over multiple generations. They are also transparent, which is especially useful for watching how organs develop as the zebrafish matures.\nZebrafish share a high degree of genetic homology with humans!\n\n\nOpen ZFIN and search for the zebrafish homolog usta. The ZFIN search bar will offer some options to refine your search. Choose “Gene/Transcript” from the drop down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZFIN takes you directly to the gene page for usta. A summary of basic information about usta is at the top, with more detailed sections as you scroll down. Without much searching, we discover that usta is located on chromosome 20 and is predicted to enable sulfotransferase activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on “Gene Ontology” in the menu on the left takes you to a more detailed list of the molecular functions associated with usta. The summary on top just mentioned the words “sulfotransferase activity”; in the Gene Ontology section, we learn that usta is involved in catalytic activity and enzyme regulator activity as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can turn to the human homolog UST. There are several databases with information about human genes. GeneCards is a user-friendly database that collects and displays information about human genes from multiple research databases. It is maintained as a joint effort between the Weizmann Institute of Science and LifeMap Sciences.\nOpen the GeneCards page and search for the human homolog UST in the “Explore a Gene” search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike MGI or ZFIN, the GeneCards page on our searched gene doesn’t have the information about location at the top. Instead, we will need to click on “Genomics” in the header menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genomics section of the GeneCards page includes location information for multiple assemblies, as well as a map of the chromosome. UST is located on chromosome 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA genome assembly is just a version of the genome map. As scientists unlock more detail about genomes, they periodically publish an updated “reference genome”, with everything we have discovered about where genes, enhancers, promotors, and non-coding regions are located in the genome. Think of an updated genome assembly as a better map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find information about UST’s molecular function. Choosing “Function” from the menu takes us to a list of gene ontology terms (commonly called GO terms) associated with UST. There are a lot of words you might recognize, including sulfotransferase activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn to look up information about the homologs of your four Drosophila genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK TWO\n\n\n\nFor each of the Drosophila genes (scarlet, plum, mustard, and white), find the following information for the mouse, zebrafish, and human homologs:\n\nname\nchromosomal location\nmolecular function\n\nDoes this information differ among the homologs? For example, do the homologs of scarlet do the same things as scarlet?"

    "text": "Part 3\nIn addition to the experimental data you’re sorting through, you notice that someone has collected literature on different human diseases. You assume these diseases are thought to be caused in part by some of the human homologs of the genes your lab is studying, so you decide to look up the information using a pair of human disease databases.\nOMIM, short for Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, is a comprehensive database of human genes and genetic phenotypes. It is maintained by the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.\nMalaCards is a searchable database offering information on human diseases, medical conditions, and disorders. It is maintained as a joint effort between the Weizmann Institute of Science and LifeMap Sciences.\nBoth databases will give you the information you need. We’ll go through how to use both, but you only need to use one for this activity.\nLet’s start with OMIM. Click on the link or type “https://omim.org” into your browser. On the landing page, you can type either a disease or a gene name into the search bar. (Just remember to use the human gene name or gene ID!)\nEarlier, we discovered the human homolog of pipe is UST. Let’s look this gene up and see what (if any) diseases it might be associated with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur search pulls up a list of entries associated with our search term. For UST, there’s only one. Click on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach entry in OMIM will have a table of contents on the left hand side of the page. In the case of UST, there’s not much there. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any subsection focusing on disease state or phenotype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a comparison, we can search for the known disease risk gene BRCA1, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. When we look at the top OMIM hit for BRCA1, we can see a section in the table of contents called “Gene-Phenotype Relationships”. This is the section where OMIM displays any possible disease phenotype associated with the gene.\nSince we don’t see this section for UST, we can conclude that UST doesn’t appear to cause any human diseases that we know of at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find similar information on the MalaCards website. Click the link or type “https://www.malacards.org” into your browser to open the webpage. Then type “UST” into the bottom search bar. (Although you can look up genes on MalaCards, most of the time you look up a a disease to find out what genes are associated with it instead of the other way around.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we used the “search any term” search bar, MalaCards will look for the term “UST” on all the disease pages in the database. The results are ordered with the best-matching page on top. Click “Crohn’s Disease” to see why “UST” matched this entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne nice thing about MalaCards is that the search term is highlighted in yellow when you open the page. In this case, we can see that “UST” actually matched part of drug that was investigated as a treatment for Crohn’s disease. This suggests that the gene UST is not found in any of the MalaCards disease entry.\nLet’s search MalaCards with the term “BRCA1” to see what it looks like when the gene name is found in an entry. In the top hit entry (“Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer Syndrome), we can see the actual gene name BRCA1 shows up in the overview, as well as in the section about associated genes and the alternate name for the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn to look up information the diseases (if any) your four human homologs might be associated with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK THREE\n\n\n\nWhat human disease or disorder (if any) are the homologs of scarlet, plum, mustard, and white associated with?"
