    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\n\nBackground\nFirst, let’s read the “plain language” summary from a publication entitled “Rare variants implicate NMDA receptor signaling and cerebellar gene networks in risk for bipolar disorder”.\n\nThis research explores the genetic basis of bipolar disorder, a serious mental health condition where people experience extreme mood swings between mania and depression. The researchers studied DNA from 41 families with multiple members affected by bipolar disorder. They identified 741 genes potentially linked to bipolar disorder, which overlapped with genes known to be involved in other brain development disorders. Their most significant finding was a specific variant in a gene called DAO (D-amino acid oxidase). When they tested this variant in human cells, it reduced the amount and activity of the DAO protein. In mice with the equivalent genetic change, they observed: (1) less DAO protein in certain brain regions, (2) greater susceptibility to stress, (3) altered responses to drugs affecting NMDAR (a type of brain receptor), and (4) changes in gene activity patterns in the cerebellum (a brain region). The team also found similar gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of human bipolar disorder patients. The study suggests bipolar disorder may involve disruptions to NMDAR signaling and gene expression in the cerebellum, providing new insights into how this condition develops at the molecular level.\n\nAs the researchers mentioned in their summary, bipolar disorder is neuropsychiatric disorder that affects moods. “Neuropsychiatric” means that it involves both the structure of the brain and mental health. People with bipolar disorder may experience “low” periods of intense sadness, low energy, low motivation, and loss of interest in daily activities, as well as “high periods” of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and potentially hallucinations or an altered sense of reality. While everyone will experience mood swings, in people with bipolar disorder these swings are more extreme and may last for weeks. Bipolar disorder is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the risk of developing bipolar disorder is about 1% for the general public. For someone who has a parent with bipolar disorder, this risk is between 10% and 25%. Interestingly, people who have a parent with schizophrenia also have an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder compared to the general population, which suggests there may be a shared genetic basis to both disorders (as well as with major depression).\nThe cerebellum is the region of the brain located just above the spinal cord. Size-wise, it’s about 10% of the brain, but it contains roughly 50% of the neurons. Scientists started noticing more than 200 years ago that people with cerebellum injuries frequently had difficulty maintaining their balance (either while standing or while walking), as well as difficulty with judging how far to reach when picking up objects. People with these types of injuries may also have difficulty judging how far objects are, learning new motor skills, or keeping consistent timing when tapping their fingers. The cerebellum essentially coordinates motor movement and gait, maintains posture and balance, and controls muscle tone (the amount of tension in the muscle) and voluntary muscle activity. More recently, scientists have discovered that the cerebellum also plays a role in attention, language, and regulating emotional responses like fear and pleasure, though the specific details on how are still under investigation.\nNMDA receptors (NMDAR), or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, are a type of glutamate receptor in the brain. When an NMDAR binds both glutamate and glycine, it opens a channel that allows positively charged ions (like calcium ions) to flow into the neuron. The movement of calcium ions through NMDARs is thought to be particularly important for memory and learning. Drugs such as alcohol, PCP, ketamine, and nitrous oxide block NMDAR activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the DAO gene do?\nHow did researchers identify DAO and other possible genes linked to bipolar disorder?\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will construct a pedigree from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename your project “Family Markers” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the kinship2 package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"kinship2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(kinship2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\n\n\n\n\nGet Pedigree Data\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nped_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/pedigree_data.csv\")\nped_data\n\n   ped id father mother sex bipolar depression diagnosis_available DAO IL6\n1    1  1      0      0   1      NA         NA                   0        \n2    1  2      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n3    1  3      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n4    1  4      1      2   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n5    1  5      1      2   2      NA         NA                   0        \n6    1  6      1      2   1      NA         NA                   0        \n7    1  7      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n8    1  8      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n9    1  9      4      3   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n10   1 10      4      3   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/V\n11   1 11      4      3   1       0          1                   1        \n12   1 12      4      3   2      NA         NA                   0        \n13   1 13      0      0   1       0          0                   1        \n14   1 14      6      7   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n15   1 15      9      8   2      NA         NA                   0        \n16   1 16      9      8   1       0          1                   1        \n17   1 17      9      8   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/+\n18   1 18     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n19   1 19     13     12   2       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n20   1 20     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n\n\nIf everything went correctly, you should see both an object called ped_data in the Environment Pane (top right) and the data printed to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an R object?\n\n\n\nAn object is something stored in a programming language, such as data. Think of it like a “noun”.\nIn R, we assign objects using the &lt;- symbol, with the name of your choice on the left, and the contents of the object on the right.\nObjects will show up in your Environment Pane.

    "section": "Part 1",
    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. Researchers then bred the mice and looked for differences in gene expression in the brains of the offspring.\n\nBackground\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Although ASD can be diagnosed at any age, it’s considered a neurodevelopmental disorder because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems.\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\nThe original study\nThe original study, Gut Microbiota from Human Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\nThe mouse as a model organism\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models (https://www.cshl.edu/of-mice-and-model-organisms/, https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes).\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? Well, first, they’re economical and relatively easy to keep. Since mice are small, they don’t require a huge amount of space or food. They also have fast reproductive cycles, so researchers can study multiple generations within only a few years. Most importantly, though, mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases. They are particularly important model organisms for cancer research and neuroscience.\nYou can find additional information about how the mouse is used in research here!\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will explore the data from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\nTODO: Add figure\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\nTODO: Add figure\nRename your project “Differential Expression ASD” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTODO: Add figure\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “tidyverse” package that you loaded is useful for loading, wrangling, and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Differential Expression Data\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nprefrontal &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nYou have just loaded differential expression data comparing ASD-transplant mice and control-transplant mice for the prefrontal cortex region of the brain."

A data dictionary is a key to decode these!\ngene: the geneID (see below for more detail). baseMean: the average of the normalized count values for this gene, taken over all samples. log2FoldChange: a measure of the change in gene expression for this gene between the ASD and control mice. A positive value indicates upregulation (increased expression), while a negative Log2FC indicates downregulation (decreased expression). lfcSE: the standard error calculated for log2FoldChange. stat: t-value calculated to determine if the log2FoldChange is significantly different from zero. pvalue: the p-value for the log2FoldChange. padj: the p-value, adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n\nIn this dataset, genes are identified using their Ensembl Gene ID code. Every gene has an ID that looks something like this:\n\nENSMUSG00000000001\n\nENS stands for “Ensembl”. Ensembl is a genome database project managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute. It’s one of several databases like this. Others include NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; the organization that manages GenBank and PubMed) and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. When a gene code starts with “ENS”, it means you should look up the gene code in the Ensembl database.\nMUS stands for “Mus”, which is the genus for the mouse.\nG stands for “Gene”. When you see “G” in the ID name, you know you are working with a gene. There are also codes for transcripts (“T”), exons (“E”), and proteins (“P”).\n00000000001 is the numerical code associated with the gene.\n\nRanking the genes by log2FoldChange\nThe log2FoldChange value gives us an idea of which genes show the greatest differential expression between the ASD mice and the control mice. We can arrange the table based on these values (going from smallest to largest) by copying the following code into your console:\n\nprefrontal_ascending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, log2FoldChange)\nhead(prefrontal_ascending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE   stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000080716     25.4          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  6.05e-31 3.64e-27\n2 ENSMUSG00000111968     25.0          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  5.79e-31 3.64e-27\n3 ENSMUSG00000090303     23.2          -25.1  1.92 -13.1  3.75e-39 1.36e-34\n4 ENSMUSG00000062818     21.2          -25.0  2.36 -10.6  3.54e-26 1.07e-22\n5 ENSMUSG00000101734     20.2          -24.9  2.06 -12.1  8.68e-34 1.04e-29\n6 ENSMUSG00000110465     20.0          -24.9  2.56  -9.72 2.57e-22 3.31e-19\n\n\nWe can use a similar command to look at the genes with the largest positive log2FoldChange.\n\nprefrontal_descending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, desc(log2FoldChange))\nhead(prefrontal_descending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000113093     17.0           24.6  2.93  8.37 5.63e-17 2.86e-14\n2 ENSMUSG00000112524     15.3           24.4  2.70  9.05 1.44e-19 1.06e-16\n3 ENSMUSG00000069301     13.9           24.3  2.73  8.91 5.30e-19 3.36e-16\n4 ENSMUSG00000104341     12.5           24.1  2.93  8.23 1.88e-16 9.06e-14\n5 ENSMUSG00000073974     15.0           24.1  2.70  8.92 4.87e-19 3.14e-16\n6 ENSMUSG00000054136     11.9           24.1  2.50  9.61 7.22e-22 7.66e-19\n\n\nTODO: Add details about positive vs negative values, ask students to identify which ones have the greatest log2FoldChange\n\n\nUsing the Mouse Genome Database\nWe have identified the genes (by their geneID) that show the greatest differential expression between ASD and control mice. Now let’s find out what those genes do!\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. (An Open Reading Frame, or ORF, is a stretch of DNA between a start codon and a stop codon that can be translated into a protein.) Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: Add questions that have students look information up on MGI. Add more MGI information on reg3a"

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nBefore starting this activity, you should have completed the miniCURE activities and identified genes of interest for your individual project. Remember, the basic steps of your analysis are:\n\nExamine expression of your gene of interest expressed in this dataset.\nExplore whether your gene of interest is differentially expressed in different experimental groups.\nCharacterize the genes that are differentially expressed between the experimental groups based on their molecular activity.\n\nBelow, we’ve included a cheatsheet of some of the analysis steps you might want to do and the R code that helps you do it.\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will explore the data from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\nTODO: Add figure\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\nTODO: Add figure\nRename your project “Differential Expression ASD” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTODO: Add figure\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “tidyverse” package that you loaded is useful for loading, wrangling, and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the data\nYou have the option to look at gene expression in control vs ASD mice, as well as gene expression in both striatum and prefrontal cortex. All the mice were male and sacrificed at the same age (45 days).\nAdditionally, you can look at gene expression in striatum vs prefrontal cortex in only ASD mice or only control mice. Likewise, you also have the option of looking at gene expression in ASD and control mice, focusing only on striatum or only on prefrontal cortex.\nLet’s say you want to open the dataset that compares gene expression between ASD and control mice in both brain regions and call it asd_vs_c. We will do this using read_csv. Copy and paste this command into your console:\n\nasd_vs_c &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nHere are the URLs for all the possible comparisons you can examine with this dataset:\nComparing gene expression between ASD and control mice\nBoth brain regions: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol.csv\nPrefrontal cortex only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\nStriatum only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv\nComparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum\nAll mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype.csv\nOnly ASD mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype_in_ASDmice.csv\nOnly control mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_tissuetype_in_controlmice.csv\n\n\nArranging dataset based on padj\nYou’re mostly interested in identifying the genes that have been differentially expressed between your two groups (in this case, ASD mouse brains and control mouse brains). You can use the arrange command to sort the results to put the smallest padj values first.\n\nasd_vs_c_sorted &lt;- arrange(asd_vs_c, padj)\nhead(asd_vs_c_sorted)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000089657     16.9          -25.5  1.81 -14.1 2.18e-45 7.29e-41\n2 ENSMUSG00000083812     14.6          -25.4  1.80 -14.1 3.82e-45 7.29e-41\n3 ENSMUSG00000094151     11.2          -25.0  1.79 -14.0 2.97e-44 3.77e-40\n4 ENSMUSG00000102414     14.9          -25.4  1.89 -13.4 4.00e-41 3.81e-37\n5 ENSMUSG00000074445     11.5          -25.0  1.89 -13.3 3.44e-40 2.62e-36\n6 ENSMUSG00000053773     10.6          -24.9  1.99 -12.5 6.66e-36 4.23e-32\n\n\n\n\nCreating a gene list\nNext, you might want to create a list of all the genes that are differentially expressed between your two groups using the filter command. Make sure to check that your gene list has enough genes on it using head and dim (and that you have a good ratio of “real” positive versus false positive results).\nThis step requires some thought as to what you want to set as your padj threshold! Remember, you want to make sure you have a minimal number of false positive results, while also still keeping enough genes for future analyses.\n\nasd_vs_c_sig &lt;- filter(asd_vs_c, padj &lt; 0.05)\nhead(asd_vs_c_sig)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000089657     16.9          -25.5  1.81 -14.1 2.18e-45 7.29e-41\n2 ENSMUSG00000083812     14.6          -25.4  1.80 -14.1 3.82e-45 7.29e-41\n3 ENSMUSG00000094151     11.2          -25.0  1.79 -14.0 2.97e-44 3.77e-40\n4 ENSMUSG00000102414     14.9          -25.4  1.89 -13.4 4.00e-41 3.81e-37\n5 ENSMUSG00000074445     11.5          -25.0  1.89 -13.3 3.44e-40 2.62e-36\n6 ENSMUSG00000053773     10.6          -24.9  1.99 -12.5 6.66e-36 4.23e-32\n\ndim(asd_vs_c_sig)\n\n[1] 10  7\n\n\n\n\nExploring genes of interest with the Mouse Genome Informatics database\nTODO: Change this so they look up geneIDs for their genes of interest??\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Clicking on the blue squares takes you to a page with more information about how that particular gene was assigned to a pathway or molecular process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare differential gene expression across regions\nIt might be interesting to look at the expression of a gene across all the possible regions. To do this, we will first load the region-specific datasets.\n\nasd_vs_c_prefrontal &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nasd_vs_c_striatum &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_autism_deseq_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThen we’ll filter out the gene in which we’re interested from each object. Let’s take a look at gene ENSMUSG00000079516, which is the reg3a gene we previously looked up on MGI.\n\nreg3a_prefrontal &lt;- filter(asd_vs_c_prefrontal, gene == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\")\n\nreg3a_striatum &lt;- filter(asd_vs_c_striatum, gene == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\")\n\nFinally, take a look at the differential expression of reg3a in each region.\nIn the prefrontal cortex:\n\nreg3a_prefrontal\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000079516     10.6          -22.6  2.11 -10.7 7.30e-27 2.63e-23\n\n\nIn the striatum:\n\nreg3a_striatum\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat pvalue  padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000079516    0.371           2.27  2.96 0.765  0.444    NA\n\n\n\n\nPlotting a single gene across regions\n\nTODO: Figure out the bespoke function `PlotAcrossRegions`\nplotAcrossRegions(\"FBgn0000003\")\nENSMUSG00000079516\n\n\n\nRunning a gene set analysis\nYou can use the special command runClusterProfiler to figure out the types of processes genes on your gene list are involved in. You can also create a dotplot to visualize your results.\n\nTODO: Verify if `runClusterProfiler` is a bespoke function\n\nasd_vs_c_clusters &lt;- runClusterProfiler(asd_vs_c_sig)\n\ndotplot(asd_vs_c_clusters, showCategory=34, title=\"a1 vs p1\", font.size=10, label_format = 50)\n\nEXTRA UNNEEDED CODE (possibly needed to replace a bespoke function to create a plot across regions): Since we’re working with two separate datasets, let’s add a column to each dataset so we know whether we’re looking at expression data in prefrontal cortex or striatum.\n\nasd_vs_c_prefrontal$region &lt;- \"prefrontal_cortex\"\n\nasd_vs_c_striatum$region &lt;- \"striatum\"\n\nIf you take a look at both asd_vs_c_prefrontal and asd_vs_c_striatum, you’ll see that the new column has been added on the rightmost side of the data.\n\nhead(asd_vs_c_prefrontal)\nhead(asd_vs_c_striatum)\n\nNext, we’ll combine our two filtered datasets to make one single dataset that only contains expression of the reg3a gene. We’ll combine the datasets with the bind_rows. This command essentially “glues” the two datasets together, one on top of the other.\n\nreg3a &lt;- bind_rows(reg3a_prefrontal, reg3a_striatum)\nhead(reg3a)"

    "text": "The original study\nThe original study, Gut Microbiota from Human Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\nYou can read the original research paper here."
