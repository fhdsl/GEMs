    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\n\nBackground\nFirst, let’s read the “plain language” summary from a publication entitled “Rare variants implicate NMDA receptor signaling and cerebellar gene networks in risk for bipolar disorder” [1].\n\nThis research explores the genetic basis of bipolar disorder, a serious mental health condition where people experience extreme mood swings between mania and depression. The researchers studied DNA from 41 families with multiple members affected by bipolar disorder. They identified 741 genes potentially linked to bipolar disorder, which overlapped with genes known to be involved in other brain development disorders. Their most significant finding was a specific variant in a gene called DAO (D-amino acid oxidase). When they tested this variant in human cells, it reduced the amount and activity of the DAO protein. In mice with the equivalent genetic change, they observed: (1) less DAO protein in certain brain regions, (2) greater susceptibility to stress, (3) altered responses to drugs affecting NMDAR (a type of brain receptor), and (4) changes in gene activity patterns in the cerebellum (a brain region). The team also found similar gene expression patterns in the cerebellum of human bipolar disorder patients. The study suggests bipolar disorder may involve disruptions to NMDAR signaling and gene expression in the cerebellum, providing new insights into how this condition develops at the molecular level.\n\nAs the researchers mentioned in their summary, bipolar disorder is neuropsychiatric disorder that affects moods. “Neuropsychiatric” means that it involves both the structure of the brain and mental health. People with bipolar disorder may experience “low” periods of intense sadness, low energy, low motivation, and loss of interest in daily activities, as well as “high periods” of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and potentially hallucinations or an altered sense of reality. While everyone will experience mood swings, in people with bipolar disorder these swings are more extreme and may last for weeks. Bipolar disorder is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and the risk of developing bipolar disorder is about 1% for the general public. For someone who has a parent with bipolar disorder, this risk is between 10% and 25%. Interestingly, people who have a parent with schizophrenia also have an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder compared to the general population, which suggests there may be a shared genetic basis to both disorders (as well as with major depression).\nThe cerebellum is the region of the brain located just above the spinal cord. Size-wise, it’s about 10% of the brain, but it contains roughly 50% of the neurons. Scientists started noticing more than 200 years ago that people with cerebellum injuries frequently had difficulty maintaining their balance (either while standing or while walking), as well as difficulty with judging how far to reach when picking up objects. People with these types of injuries may also have difficulty judging how far objects are, learning new motor skills, or keeping consistent timing when tapping their fingers. The cerebellum essentially coordinates motor movement and gait, maintains posture and balance, and controls muscle tone (the amount of tension in the muscle) and voluntary muscle activity. More recently, scientists have discovered that the cerebellum also plays a role in attention, language, and regulating emotional responses like fear and pleasure, though the specific details on how are still under investigation.\nNMDA receptors (NMDAR), or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors, are a type of glutamate receptor in the brain. When an NMDAR binds both glutamate and glycine, it opens a channel that allows positively charged ions (like calcium ions) to flow into the neuron. The movement of calcium ions through NMDARs is thought to be particularly important for memory and learning. Drugs such as alcohol, PCP, ketamine, and nitrous oxide block NMDAR activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the DAO gene do?\nHow did researchers identify DAO and other possible genes linked to bipolar disorder?\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will construct a pedigree from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity. Go to https://posit.cloud/plans/free and follow the steps to sign up. You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename your project “Family Markers” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the kinship2 package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"kinship2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(kinship2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\n\n\n\n\nGet Pedigree Data\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nped_data &lt;- read.csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/pedigree_data.csv\")\nped_data\n\n   ped id father mother sex bipolar depression diagnosis_available DAO IL6\n1    1  1      0      0   1      NA         NA                   0        \n2    1  2      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n3    1  3      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n4    1  4      1      2   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n5    1  5      1      2   2      NA         NA                   0        \n6    1  6      1      2   1      NA         NA                   0        \n7    1  7      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n8    1  8      0      0   2      NA         NA                   0        \n9    1  9      4      3   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n10   1 10      4      3   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/V\n11   1 11      4      3   1       0          1                   1        \n12   1 12      4      3   2      NA         NA                   0        \n13   1 13      0      0   1       0          0                   1        \n14   1 14      6      7   1       1          0                   1 +/V +/+\n15   1 15      9      8   2      NA         NA                   0        \n16   1 16      9      8   1       0          1                   1        \n17   1 17      9      8   1       0          0                   1 +/+ +/+\n18   1 18     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n19   1 19     13     12   2       1          0                   1 +/V +/V\n20   1 20     13     12   2       0          1                   1        \n\n\nIf everything went correctly, you should see both an object called ped_data in the Environment Pane (top right) and the data printed to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an R object?\n\n\n\nAn object is something stored in a programming language, such as data. Think of it like a “noun”.\nIn R, we assign objects using the &lt;- symbol, with the name of your choice on the left, and the contents of the object on the right.\nObjects will show up in your Environment Pane.

It is maintained by a consortium of Drosophila researchers and computer scientists at Harvard University, University of Cambridge (UK), Indiana University, and the University of New Mexico [1].\nFirst, open the FlyBase website by clicking the link or typing “https://flybase.org” into your browser. Then, type the name of the gene into the “J2G” bar in the upper right hand corner. (J2G stands for “Jump to Gene”.) As an example, try typing the gene name pipe and click enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene page for pipe will load. On the top of the page, you will see the general information about this gene, including the FlyBase gene ID and a brief description of what this gene does.\nBelow this general information section, the genomic location data will appear. There are several different ways gene locations might be recorded; for our purposes, we’re interested in the sequence location. The pipe gene is located. “3L” means this gene is on the left arm of the third chromosome. The numbers after 3L refer to the nucleotide location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can scroll down the page or click the menu on the right-hand side to move to additional sections. The next section we’re interested in is the function section. Here, we can see what the general molecular function of the gene is, what sorts of biological processes the gene product (the protein) is involved in, and where the protein is found in the cell, or the cellular component. In the case of pipe, we can see that it’s an enzyme involved in development, gene expression, protein metabolism. We also see that the pipe protein is found in the membrane and endomembrane system, as well as in the nucleus around the chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScrolling down further takes us to a section with more details about the gene function. You may need to click on the small plus sign to view the details (or click on the minus sign to hide the details). We can see that pipe codes for an enzyme that is enables endopeptidase activator activity and protein binding.\nNow it’s your turn to look up your four genes in FlyBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK ONE\n\n\n\nFor each gene (scarlet, plum, mustard, and white), find the following information:\n\nFlyBase gene ID\nchromosomal location\nmolecular function\nthe biological processes the gene product is involved in\nwhere in the cell the gene product can be found"

Many genes in Drosophila have homologs in the human genome, as well as in the genomes of common model organisms like mice and zebrafish.\nAn ortholog is another term for a gene or protein that is similar due to having a common evolutionary origin, but in order to be an ortholog, the two genes must also have similar functions within the different species. An ortholog is a specialized kind of homolog.\nGenomic databases will report both homologs and orthologs.\n\n\nFirst, we need to find out what the name of the homologous genes are. The gene IDs and common names differ between species. If we keep scrolling down the page on the pipe gene in FlyBase, we can find what those homologous genes are called in our species of interest.\nIt turns out that the human gene most likely to be a homolog of pipe is called UST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we scroll down a little farther, we see that the most likely homologous mouse (Mus musculus) is called Ust. In the zebrafish (Danio rerio), it is most likely to be usta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find out more information about these homologs, we’re going to need to look at additional species-specific databases. Let’s start with the mouse.\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database is the international database for the laboratory mouse, integrating genetic, genomic, and biological data as part of an effort to use the mouse to study human health and disease. It is maintained by the Jackson Laboratory [2].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we have a database devoted to the mouse?\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models (https://www.cshl.edu/of-mice-and-model-organisms/, https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes).\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? One reason is that mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases.\n\n\nOpen the MGI database and search for the name of the mouse homolog Ust. You can do this either by typing Ust into the search bar and clicking “Quick Search” or by doing a topic specific search with the “Genes” toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “Genome Features” summary table should open up with information about Ust. MGI tells us that Ust is a protein-coding gene on chromosome 10. Clicking on the highlighted gene symbol will take us to a page with more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kinds of information you found in FlyBase will also be present on the detailed gene page in MGI. The information is organized into sections, similar to what you’ve already experienced with FlyBase. The fourth section down includes information about the human ortholog to Ust - it turns out to be UST, which we already knew from FlyBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFarther down the page is a section called “Gene Ontology (GO) Classifications”. This is the section that has information about the molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components for Ust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“Gene ontology” is a bioinformatics initiative focused on standardizing the vocabulary and annotations researchers use to describe genes, proteins, and data about gene and protein function. This effort allows us to more easily make comparisons about homologous and orthologous genes and proteins across species.\n\n\nIn mice, Ust is a tranferase (an enzyme!) involved in carbohydrate derivative binding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to look up information about the zebrafish homolog, we need to switch databases again.\nThe ZFIN (Zebrafish Information Network  is the database of genetic and genomic data for the zebrafish as a model organism. It was formed by a group of zebrafish researchers at Cold Spring Harbor and is maintained by the ZFIN Database Team at the University of Oregon [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy do we have a database devoted to the zebrafish?\nZebrafish are a popular model organism for researchers who focus on developmental biology, genetics, and modeling diseases. They develop rapidly and have high fertility, so it can be relatively quick and fast to study the effects of genes or diseases over multiple generations. They are also transparent, which is especially useful for watching how organs develop as the zebrafish matures.\nZebrafish share a high degree of genetic homology with humans!\n\n\nOpen ZFIN and search for the zebrafish homolog usta. The ZFIN search bar will offer some options to refine your search. Choose “Gene/Transcript” from the drop down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZFIN takes you directly to the gene page for usta. A summary of basic information about usta is at the top, with more detailed sections as you scroll down. Without much searching, we discover that usta is located on chromosome 20 and is predicted to enable sulfotransferase activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on “Gene Ontology” in the menu on the left takes you to a more detailed list of the molecular functions associated with usta. The summary on top just mentioned the words “sulfotransferase activity”; in the Gene Ontology section, we learn that usta is involved in catalytic activity and enzyme regulator activity as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can turn to the human homolog UST. There are several databases with information about human genes. GeneCards is a user-friendly database that collects and displays information about human genes from multiple research databases. It is maintained as a joint effort between the Weizmann Institute of Science and LifeMap Sciences [4].\nOpen the GeneCards page and search for the human homolog UST in the “Explore a Gene” search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike MGI or ZFIN, the GeneCards page on our searched gene doesn’t have the information about location at the top. Instead, we will need to click on “Genomics” in the header menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genomics section of the GeneCards page includes location information for multiple assemblies, as well as a map of the chromosome. UST is located on chromosome 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA genome assembly is just a version of the genome map. As scientists unlock more detail about genomes, they periodically publish an updated “reference genome”, with everything we have discovered about where genes, enhancers, promotors, and non-coding regions are located in the genome. Think of an updated genome assembly as a better map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find information about UST’s molecular function. Choosing “Function” from the menu takes us to a list of gene ontology terms (commonly called GO terms) associated with UST. There are a lot of words you might recognize, including sulfotransferase activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn to look up information about the homologs of your four Drosophila genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK TWO\n\n\n\nFor each of the Drosophila genes (scarlet, plum, mustard, and white), find the following information for the mouse, zebrafish, and human homologs:\n\nname\nchromosomal location\nmolecular function\n\nDoes this information differ among the homologs? For example, do the homologs of scarlet do the same things as scarlet?"

    "text": "Part 3\nIn addition to the experimental data you’re sorting through, you notice that someone has collected literature on different human diseases. You assume these diseases are thought to be caused in part by some of the human homologs of the genes your lab is studying, so you decide to look up the information using a pair of human disease databases.\nOMIM, short for Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, is a comprehensive database of human genes and genetic phenotypes. It is maintained by the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.\nMalaCards is a searchable database offering information on human diseases, medical conditions, and disorders. It is maintained as a joint effort between the Weizmann Institute of Science and LifeMap Sciences.\nBoth databases will give you the information you need. We’ll go through how to use both, but you only need to use one for this activity.\nLet’s start with OMIM. Click on the link or type “https://omim.org” into your browser. On the landing page, you can type either a disease or a gene name into the search bar. (Just remember to use the human gene name or gene ID!)\nEarlier, we discovered the human homolog of pipe is UST. Let’s look this gene up and see what (if any) diseases it might be associated with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur search pulls up a list of entries associated with our search term. For UST, there’s only one. Click on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach entry in OMIM will have a table of contents on the left hand side of the page. In the case of UST, there’s not much there. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any subsection focusing on disease state or phenotype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a comparison, we can search for the known disease risk gene BRCA1, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. When we look at the top OMIM hit for BRCA1, we can see a section in the table of contents called “Gene-Phenotype Relationships”. This is the section where OMIM displays any possible disease phenotype associated with the gene.\nSince we don’t see this section for UST, we can conclude that UST doesn’t appear to cause any human diseases that we know of at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find similar information on the MalaCards website. Click the link or type “https://www.malacards.org” into your browser to open the webpage. Then type “UST” into the bottom search bar. (Although you can look up genes on MalaCards, most of the time you look up a a disease to find out what genes are associated with it instead of the other way around.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we used the “search any term” search bar, MalaCards will look for the term “UST” on all the disease pages in the database. The results are ordered with the best-matching page on top. Click “Crohn’s Disease” to see why “UST” matched this entry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne nice thing about MalaCards is that the search term is highlighted in yellow when you open the page. In this case, we can see that “UST” actually matched part of drug that was investigated as a treatment for Crohn’s disease. This suggests that the gene UST is not found in any of the MalaCards disease entry.\nLet’s search MalaCards with the term “BRCA1” to see what it looks like when the gene name is found in an entry. In the top hit entry (“Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer Syndrome), we can see the actual gene name BRCA1 shows up in the overview, as well as in the section about associated genes and the alternate name for the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn to look up information the diseases (if any) your four human homologs might be associated with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTASK THREE\n\n\n\nWhat human disease or disorder (if any) are the homologs of scarlet, plum, mustard, and white associated with?"

    "section": "Part 1",
    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. Researchers then bred the mice and looked for differences in gene expression in the brains of the offspring.\n\nBackground\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Although ASD can be diagnosed at any age, it’s considered a neurodevelopmental disorder because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems.\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\nThe original study\nThe original study, Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\nThe mouse as a model organism\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models (https://www.cshl.edu/of-mice-and-model-organisms/, https://fbresearch.org/medical-advances/nobel-prizes).\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? Well, first, they’re economical and relatively easy to keep. Since mice are small, they don’t require a huge amount of space or food. They also have fast reproductive cycles, so researchers can study multiple generations within only a few years. Most importantly, though, mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases. They are particularly important model organisms for cancer research and neuroscience.\nYou can find additional information about how the mouse is used in research here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gut-brain axis?\nWhy do you think the researchers looked at gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum?\nWhy are mice useful as model organisms for human disease studies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code. You will see a lot of red text, but usually that’s a good thing!\n\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\n\nInstalling package into '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nInstalling package into '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\n\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are R Packages?\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “readr” package is helpful for loading data, and the “dplyr” package that you loaded is useful wrangling and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Differential Expression Data\nDifferential expression refers to the process where different cells within an organism, even those with the same DNA, express different genes, with some genes being expressed or “turned on”, while others are “turned off”. This expression difference is the basis of cell type diversity in multicellular organisms (like mice and humans). Because some diseases are thought to be the result of improper gene expression, researchers will use differential gene expression experiments to pinpoint the genes responsible for the disease symptoms.\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nprefrontal &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nYou have just loaded differential expression data comparing ASD-transplant mice and control-transplant mice for the prefrontal cortex region of the brain."

A data dictionary is a key to decode these!\n\ngene: the geneID (see below for more detail).\nbaseMean: the average of the normalized count values for this gene, taken over all samples.\nlog2FoldChange: a measure of the change in gene expression for this gene between the ASD and control mice. A positive value indicates upregulation (increased expression), while a negative Log2FC indicates downregulation (decreased expression).\nlfcSE: the standard error calculated for log2FoldChange.\nstat: t-value calculated to determine if the log2FoldChange is significantly different from zero.\npvalue: the p-value for the log2FoldChange.\npadj: the p-value, adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n\n\nIn this dataset, genes are identified using their Ensembl Gene ID code. Every gene has an ID that looks something like this:\n\nENSMUSG00000000001\n\nENS stands for “Ensembl”. Ensembl is a genome database project managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute. It’s one of several databases like this. Others include NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; the organization that manages GenBank and PubMed) and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. When a gene code starts with “ENS”, it means you should look up the gene code in the Ensembl database.\nMUS stands for “Mus”, which is the genus for the mouse.\nG stands for “Gene”. When you see “G” in the ID name, you know you are working with a gene. There are also codes for transcripts (“T”), exons (“E”), and proteins (“P”).\n00000000001 is the numerical code associated with the gene.\n\nRanking the genes by log2FoldChange\nThe log2FoldChange value gives us an idea of which genes show the greatest differential expression between the ASD mice and the control mice. It is a ratio of how many gene transcripts were found in ASD-type mice compared to control-type mice.\nWe can arrange the table based on these values (going from smallest to largest) by copying the following code into your console:\n\nprefrontal_ascending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, log2FoldChange)\nhead(prefrontal_ascending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE   stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000080716     25.4          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  6.05e-31 3.64e-27\n2 ENSMUSG00000111968     25.0          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  5.79e-31 3.64e-27\n3 ENSMUSG00000090303     23.2          -25.1  1.92 -13.1  3.75e-39 1.36e-34\n4 ENSMUSG00000062818     21.2          -25.0  2.36 -10.6  3.54e-26 1.07e-22\n5 ENSMUSG00000101734     20.2          -24.9  2.06 -12.1  8.68e-34 1.04e-29\n6 ENSMUSG00000110465     20.0          -24.9  2.56  -9.72 2.57e-22 3.31e-19\n\n\nThe genes at the top of this table have the most negative log2FoldChange values. Negative log2FoldChange values means a decreased expression (or, a downregulation in gene expression) in the experimental group versus the control group.\nWe can use a similar command to look at the genes with the largest positive log2FoldChange. Positive log2FoldChange values indicate genes that are upregulated, or have increased expression in the experimental group versus the control group.\n\nprefrontal_descending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, desc(log2FoldChange))\nhead(prefrontal_descending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000113093     17.0           24.6  2.93  8.37 5.63e-17 2.86e-14\n2 ENSMUSG00000112524     15.3           24.4  2.70  9.05 1.44e-19 1.06e-16\n3 ENSMUSG00000069301     13.9           24.3  2.73  8.91 5.30e-19 3.36e-16\n4 ENSMUSG00000104341     12.5           24.1  2.93  8.23 1.88e-16 9.06e-14\n5 ENSMUSG00000073974     15.0           24.1  2.70  8.92 4.87e-19 3.14e-16\n6 ENSMUSG00000054136     11.9           24.1  2.50  9.61 7.22e-22 7.66e-19\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Mouse Genome Database\nWe have identified the genes (by their geneID) that show the greatest differential expression between ASD and control mice. Now let’s find out what those genes do!\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. (An Open Reading Frame, or ORF, is a stretch of DNA between a start codon and a stop codon that can be translated into a protein.) Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more.\nIf you scroll down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Gene ontology refers to a common, controlled set of vocabulary and terms that researchers use when categorizing gene and protein function, biological processes, and location within the cell. Reg3a is categorized as a protein involved in carbohydrate derivative binding, signaling receptor activity, and signaling receptor binding. Biologically, the Reg3a protein helps with cell differentiation, cell population proliferation, the immune system, and responding to stimuli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat gene shows the greatest upregulation (increase in gene expression) in ASD-type mice compared to control mice? Give both the gene ID and the gene name.\nWhat molecular functions does this gene do?\nWhat gene shows the greatest downregulation (decrease in gene expression) in ASD-type mice compared to control mice?

However, this metric isn’t always the best indicator of differential expression. The adjusted p-value, or padj, is preferred over log2FoldChange for identifying statistically significant changes in gene expression because padj accounts for multiple testing. This is crucial when analyzing a large number of genes simultaneously, as each additional statistical test increases the risk of identifying a false positive. The adjusted p-value provides a statistical correction that minimizes this risk. log2FoldChange provides information about the magnitude of expression change, while padj indicates its statistical significance.\nLet’s create a list of all the genes that are differentially expressed between ASD and control mice using the filter command.

    "section": "Part 1",
    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over some background context for this activity. Then, we’ll get set up on Posit Cloud for the next steps.\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. Researchers then bred the mice and looked for differences in gene expression in the brains of the offspring.\n\nBackground\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Although ASD can be diagnosed at any age, it’s considered a neurodevelopmental disorder because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems.\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\nThe original study\nThe original study, Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019 [1]. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. They transplanted stool from either humans with ASD or controls into germ-free mice and discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\nThe mouse as a model organism\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models [2], [3].\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? Well, first, they’re economical and relatively easy to keep. Since mice are small, they don’t require a huge amount of space or food. They also have fast reproductive cycles, so researchers can study multiple generations within only a few years. Most importantly, though, mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases. They are particularly important model organisms for cancer research and neuroscience.\nYou can find additional information about how the mouse is used in research here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gut-brain axis?\nWhy do you think the researchers looked at gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum?\nWhy are mice useful as model organisms for human disease studies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Posit Cloud\nIn the next steps, we will explore the data from the publication described above.\nWe will use Posit Cloud for this activity.

You can also Log In using the button on the top right if you have used Posit Cloud in the past.\nTODO: Add figure\nOnce logged in, select “New Project” and “New RStudio Project”. It will take a few seconds to deploy and load.\nTODO: Add figure\nRename your project “Differential Expression Mouse GutBrain” by clicking on “Untitled Project”.\nTODO: Add figure\n\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into your console and press return to run the code.

Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “tidyverse” package that you loaded is useful for loading, wrangling, and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoad Differential Expression Data\nDifferential expression refers to the process where different cells within an organism, even those with the same DNA, express different genes, with some genes being expressed or “turned on”, while others are “turned off”. This expression difference is the basis of cell type diversity in multicellular organisms (like mice and humans). Because some diseases are thought to be the result of improper gene expression, researchers will use differential gene expression experiments to pinpoint the genes responsible for the disease symptoms.\nWe’ll read in some data from the GEMs website. Run the following code in your console:\n\nprefrontal &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nYou have just loaded differential expression data comparing ASD-transplant mice and control-transplant mice for the prefrontal cortex region of the brain."

A data dictionary is a key to decode these!\n\ngene: the geneID (see below for more detail).\nbaseMean: the average of the normalized count values for this gene, taken over all samples.\nlog2FoldChange: a measure of the change in gene expression for this gene between the ASD and control mice. A positive value indicates upregulation (increased expression), while a negative Log2FC indicates downregulation (decreased expression).\nlfcSE: the standard error calculated for log2FoldChange.\nstat: t-value calculated to determine if the log2FoldChange is significantly different from zero.\n\n-pvalue: the p-value for the log2FoldChange.\n-padj: the p-value, adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n\nIn this dataset, genes are identified using their Ensembl Gene ID code. Every gene has an ID that looks something like this:\n\nENSMUSG00000000001\n\nENS stands for “Ensembl”. Ensembl is a genome database project managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute. It’s one of several databases like this. Others include NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; the organization that manages GenBank and PubMed) and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. When a gene code starts with “ENS”, it means you should look up the gene code in the Ensembl database.\nMUS stands for “Mus”, which is the genus for the mouse.\nG stands for “Gene”. When you see “G” in the ID name, you know you are working with a gene. There are also codes for transcripts (“T”), exons (“E”), and proteins (“P”).\n00000000001 is the numerical code associated with the gene.\n\nRanking the genes by log2FoldChange\nThe log2FoldChange value gives us an idea of which genes show the greatest differential expression between the ASD mice and the control mice. It is a ratio of how many gene transcripts were found in ASD-type mice compared to control-type mice.\nWe can arrange the table based on these values (going from smallest to largest) by copying the following code into your console:\n\nprefrontal_ascending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, log2FoldChange)\nhead(prefrontal_ascending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE   stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000080716     25.4          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  6.05e-31 3.64e-27\n2 ENSMUSG00000111968     25.0          -25.2  2.18 -11.6  5.79e-31 3.64e-27\n3 ENSMUSG00000090303     23.2          -25.1  1.92 -13.1  3.75e-39 1.36e-34\n4 ENSMUSG00000062818     21.2          -25.0  2.36 -10.6  3.54e-26 1.07e-22\n5 ENSMUSG00000101734     20.2          -24.9  2.06 -12.1  8.68e-34 1.04e-29\n6 ENSMUSG00000110465     20.0          -24.9  2.56  -9.72 2.57e-22 3.31e-19\n\n\nThe genes at the top of this table have the most negative log2FoldChange values. Negative log2FoldChange values means a decreased expression (or, a downregulation in gene expression) in the experimental group versus the control group.\nWe can use a similar command to look at the genes with the largest positive log2FoldChange. Positive log2FoldChange values indicate genes that are upregulated, or have increased expression in the experimental group versus the control group.\n\nprefrontal_descending &lt;- arrange(prefrontal, desc(log2FoldChange))\nhead(prefrontal_descending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000113093     17.0           24.6  2.93  8.37 5.63e-17 2.86e-14\n2 ENSMUSG00000112524     15.3           24.4  2.70  9.05 1.44e-19 1.06e-16\n3 ENSMUSG00000069301     13.9           24.3  2.73  8.91 5.30e-19 3.36e-16\n4 ENSMUSG00000104341     12.5           24.1  2.93  8.23 1.88e-16 9.06e-14\n5 ENSMUSG00000073974     15.0           24.1  2.70  8.92 4.87e-19 3.14e-16\n6 ENSMUSG00000054136     11.9           24.1  2.50  9.61 7.22e-22 7.66e-19\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Mouse Genome Database\nWe have identified the genes (by their geneID) that show the greatest differential expression between ASD and control mice. Now let’s find out what those genes do!\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\nTo look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. (An Open Reading Frame, or ORF, is a stretch of DNA between a start codon and a stop codon that can be translated into a protein.) Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more.\nIf you scroll down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Gene ontology refers to a common, controlled set of vocabulary and terms that researchers use when categorizing gene and protein function, biological processes, and location within the cell. Reg3a is categorized as a protein involved in carbohydrate derivative binding, signaling receptor activity, and signaling receptor binding. Biologically, the Reg3a protein helps with cell differentiation, cell population proliferation, the immune system, and responding to stimuli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Knowledge\n\n\n\n\nWhat gene shows the greatest upregulation (increase in gene expression) in ASD-type mice compared to control mice? Give both the gene ID and the gene name.\nWhat molecular functions does this gene do?\nWhat gene shows the greatest downregulation (decrease in gene expression) in ASD-type mice compared to control mice?

However, this metric isn’t always the best indicator of differential expression. The adjusted p-value, or padj, is preferred over log2FoldChange for identifying statistically significant changes in gene expression because padj accounts for multiple testing. This is crucial when analyzing a large number of genes simultaneously, as each additional statistical test increases the risk of identifying a false positive. The adjusted p-value provides a statistical correction that minimizes this risk. log2FoldChange provides information about the magnitude of expression change, while padj indicates its statistical significance.\nLet’s create a list of all the genes that are differentially expressed between ASD and control mice using the filter command.

    "text": "This module provides data for an independent project exploring differential expression in RNA-seq data.\nThis activity will walk through differential expression analysis and use bioinformatics tools (R) to understand how gut bacteria (the gut microbiome) can influence the expression of genes in the brain (the gut-brain axis). You will work with real data from a mouse RNA-seq experiment.\nThe basic steps of your analysis are:\n\nIdentify mouse genes of interest for your project.\nCharacterize the gene expression of your genes of interest in the dataset.\nExplore differential gene expression in the control vs experimental group.\n\n\n\nThe original study, Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019 [1]. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with ASD, while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. They discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\n\nThe gut-brain axis is the term used for the proposed connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. In recent years, studies have identified links between neurological symptoms and the presence of intestinal inflammation. There are around 100 million neurons in the human gut, and around 70% of the serotonin (an important neurotransmitter) in the human body is made in the gut. Communication between the microbes in the gut and the brain happens through multiple routes, including immune signaling (signals sent to the brain by immune cells), stimulation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the enteric nervous system (a system of neurons in the intestinal that are often called the “second brain”) through formation of microbial-derived metabolites like tryptophan, short-chain fatty acids, or secondary bile acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, the “up” arrow indicates an increase; this could be increased production of a protein, increased activity of a biological pathway, or a general increase in the presence of a structure. The “down” arrow indicates a decrease.\nResearchers have identified multiple ways the intestinal microbiota in the gut might remodel the structure of the nervous system. This includes changes in myelination, neurogenesis, neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity, growth of dendrites, activation of microglia, and changes in the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier. The exact mechanism for these changes is still unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy are the neural processes mentioned above important?\nmyelination: the process of forming protein sheaths (called myelin) around the long axons of nerves. This insulates the axon and improves the speed and efficiency of transmission of neural signals.\nneurogenesis: the formation of new neurons, particularly in the adult central nervous system. This is important for memory and learning.`\nsynaptic plasticity: the process of strengthening or weakening connections at the synapse of nerves (where the signal is transferred from one nerve to another). This sort of adaptive change is fundamental for memory and learning, but also helps with recovery after injury.\ndendritic growth: the process by which neurons form new branches (dendrites) and spines (small protrusions on the dendrites). This is a key aspect of synaptic plasticity and is essential for brain development, learning, and memory formation.\nmicroglia: immune cells found in the central nervous system. They support central nervous system development and synaptogenesis (formation of new synapses), maintain homeostasis, contribute to an immune response against infectious agents, and are associated with adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, degenerative diseases, stroke, trauma and regeneration.\nblood-brain-barrier: a highly selective semi-permeable barrier located in the central nervous system that separates the bloodstream from the fluid that surrounds the brain. It maintains a stable environment for neuronal function and regulates passage of molecules between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\n\nRemodeling of the nervous system via the gut microbiome is suspected to be responsible for the severity of some symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. A possible link between the gut microbiome and increased symptom severity is actively being studied for Major Depressive Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, fibromyalgia, migraines, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and more.\nThe samples in this dataset are from mice that do not carry genes associated with either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. Instead, any symptoms or changes in the brain they show are the result of microbes introduced to their gut via fecal transplant. This dataset gives you the opportunity to study possible effects of the gut-brain axis firsthand.\n\n\n\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Additionally, there are two different types of mice. Some of the mice are an Autism Spectrum Disorder-type (see below for details), while others are control-type.\nBefore you start working with the dataset, you will need to make some decisions about the questions you want to answer.\nAre you interested in exploring gene expression differences between two regions of the mouse brain, without focusing on the gut-brain axis? Expand this section to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Structure: The Striatum and the Prefrontal Cortex\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes gene expression data from two different regions in the brain: the striatum and the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\n\n\nAre you interested in exploring neurodevelopmental disorders? These are disorders that are the result of altered brain development. Although this dataset was created using “ASD-type” mice, many neurological disorders have shared symptoms and probably share a biological basis. Expand this section to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Disorders: Neurodevelopmental Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the following disorders can be diagnosed at any age, they are considered neurodevelopmental disorders because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Many of these disorders have overlapping symptoms, including difficulty managing emotions, experiencing intense emotional outbursts, a dysregulated stress response system, difficulty with executive functions (like attention regulation, organization, and planning), and issues with social communication and unspoken social norms. Many of these disorders have similar biological roots, such as neuroinflammation, genetic variation, and disruptions in systems that rely on dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (which can cause impaired connections between regions of the brain, called white matter connectivity). People with these disorders also show differences in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala compared to people without neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, malfunctioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is common in neurodevelopmental disorders. The HPA axis regulates the brain and body’s response to stress. Many people with neurodevelopmental disorders show an unusually strong reaction to stress and can have difficulty recovering from it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of all neurodevelopmental disorders - you may know of others that are not included! Any of these could be a good starting point for your research question.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems. Some genes that have been suggested as ASD risk genes include SHANK3, NRXN1, CHD8, ARIH2, ZDHHC15, and TRPC6. Individuals with ASD also show changes in both white and gray matter volume, as well as an imbalance in connectivity of neural circuits (there are more connections and stronger connections than typical within local regions of the brain, and both fewer and weaker connections between distant regions of the brain). The neural circuits that are imbalanced connect brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by difficulties with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Individuals may show predominantly inattention symptoms (predominantly inattentive ADHD), predominantly hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms (predominantly hyperactive ADHD), or a combination of all (combined type ADHD). Some proposed ADHD risk genes are SKI, ZNF544, ST3GAL3, and PEX2. Additionally, researchers believe alterations to the prefrontal cortex and the dopaminergic system are major contributing factors for ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Disorders (LDs) include disorders such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. Each of these is characterized by difficulty developing a fundamental academic skill, including reading (dyslexia), math and working with numbers (dyscalculia), writing (dysgraphia), listening (auditory processing disorder), speaking (language processing disorder), or non-verbal reasoning (nonverbal learning disorder). Individuals with LDs frequently show differences neural connectivity within brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parietal lobes, which may contribute to decreased brain processing speed and executive functioning. Research also suggests that altered tryptophan metabolism is associated with LDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMood Disorders are a group of disorders in which affected individuals exhibit emotional state changes, which can include episodes of deep sadness (dysphoria), lack of feeling anything (anhedonia), and extreme happiness or euphoria (hypomania or mania). The most well-known of these disorders are Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). Some individuals with Schizoaffective Disorder or Schizophrenia (SCZ) also experience hallucinations and psychosis. Variation in serotonin transporter genes and dopamine receptor genes have been associated with Mood Disorders, as well as neurotransmitter alterations and brain circuit dysfunction, particularly within the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system (where the amygdala is).\nMood disorders like depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia are not currently listed as neurodevelopmental disorders in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). This is the official handbook of psychiatric disorders used for diagnosis in the field. However, researchers have suggested that mood disorders should be considered neurodevelopmental disorders due to growing evidence that neurodevelopmental pathways play a role in their development and manifestation. For the purposes of this module, we have included them in the “Neurodevelopmental Disorder” section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to read more about the biology of neurodevelopmental disorders, (Bertollo et al. 2025)[https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/15/3/307] is a great starting point!\n\n\n\nAre you interested in exploring neurodegenerative disorders? These are disorders that that occur when brain structures and systems experience degradation and may be the result of similar biological processes that cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Expand this section to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Disorders: Neurodegenerative Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders are usually considered diseases of aging because a person’s risk of developing one these disorders increases as they age. These disorders are the result of the breakdown and eventual loss of neurons and synaptic connections. An individual’s specific symptoms and diagnosis are the result of where in the brain or central nervous system the breakdown of neurons and synapses occur. Although the symptoms and progression may differ between diseases, the biological basis is generally one of seven things: a genetic mutation, accumulation of misfolded proteins, excitotoxicity (overstimulation of glutamate receptors, ultimately causing cell death), loss of regulatory function of noncoding RNAs (causes biological processes to break down), oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or neuroinflammation (when the immune system attacks and damages the neurons).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of all neurodegenerative disorders - you may know of others that are not included! Any of these could be a good starting point for your research question. Remember that this is a gut-brain axis dataset, so you should verify that disorders that are not on this list do have an association with changes in the gut microbiome first.\nAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in seniors and is marked by progressive decline in memory, cognition, and behavior. It generally begins as a result of neuron loss in the hippocampus, or the region of the brain responsible for episodic memory. Beta-amyloid plaques and clumps of tau proteins are deposited on nerve cells, which prevents normal nerve impulses from traveling between neurons. This eventually leads to cell death and deterioration of brain tissue. Tau proteins are also present in normal brain tissue to stabilize microtubules and aid transport within neurons. They cause problems when they become damaged and detach from microtubules to form tangles, or clumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParkinson’s Disease (PD) is a movement disorder of the nervous system. Over time, individuals with PD lose their ability to regulate and control fine motor movement, resulting in tremors, rigid muscles, slow movement (bradykinesia), and difficulties with balance and coordination. They can also show cognitive decline. These symptoms are the result of gradual deterioration of dopamine-producing neurons, specifically in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra. The substantia nigra is responsible for motor movement and has two parts - the pars compacta, which produces dopamine, and the pars reticulata, which uses GABA (another type of neurotransmitter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective myelin covering around neurons in both the brain and the spinal cord, causing inflammation, demyelination (of loss of the protective myelin sheath), and damage to the underlying neuron. Eventually, these neurons become less efficient at passing electrical impulses to connecting neurons. Individuals with MS experience fatigue, numbness or tingling, difficulties with coordination, blurred or double vision, and memory and concentration issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is caused by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The exact mechanisms that trigger this degeneration are not known, but research has suggested that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction might contribute to the development of ALS. Additionally, the genes C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS have been identified as risk factors for developing an inherited form of the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in reading more about the biology of neurodegenerative disorders, Gadhave et al. 2021 is a good place to start!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve picked brain structure, a neurodevelopmental disorder, or a neurodegenerative disorder to focus on, you’ll want to start identifying specific genes for your research project. The following questions could be a good starting point.\n\nIs there a gene or set of genes linked to a biological process you’re particularly interested in? This could include things like “cytokines”, “anti-inflammatory genes”, “genes involved in building neurons”, or any biological process you find interesting!\nAre there a known risk genes for your disease or disorder of interest (or genes that are protective against this disorder)? Remember, you don’t have to limit yourself to Autism Spectrum Disorder, either; there are many disorders that have a shared genetic and biological basis! If you decide to start here, check that researchers have linked the symptoms of your disease or disorder of interest to the gut microbiome.\nAre you curious about the standard “housekeeping” genes that are broadly expressed across cell types and involved in common biological processes, like DNA replication, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation? These processes are vitally important for proper cellular function, so disruption in them can cause problems for the organism.\n\nOnce you’ve picked a disorder or cellular process that interests you, start looking up research papers to find genes! You can use sites like PubMed and Google Scholar to look up studies. Skim through at least 4-5 different papers that contain some type of gene name or a biological process. DO NOT GET TOO LOST INTO THE PAPERS! Make sure you skim through them for important information, but be willing to set a paper aside if you’re struggling to find what you need."

    "title": "Differential Expression and the Mouse Gut-Brain Axis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This module provides data for an independent project exploring differential expression in RNA-seq data.\nThis activity will walk through differential expression analysis and use bioinformatics tools (R) to understand how gut bacteria (the gut microbiome) can influence the expression of genes in the brain (the gut-brain axis). You will work with real data from a mouse RNA-seq experiment.\nThe basic steps of your analysis are:\n\nIdentify mouse genes of interest for your project.\nCharacterize the gene expression of your genes of interest in the dataset.\nExplore differential gene expression in the control vs experimental group.\n\n\n\nThe original study, Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Induces Behavioral Deficits in Mice, was published in 2019 [1]. Gut microbiota are known to be different between individuals with ASD and individuals who are considered typically-developing. Additionally, some individuals with ASD also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, and their gut microbiota show the greatest difference when compared to the gut microbiota of typically-developing individuals. Some researchers have proposed that gut bacteria can influence some of the symptoms of ASD. The relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the development and function of the human brain is known as the gut-brain axis.\nIn this study, researchers explored whether they could induce ASD-like behaviors in mice by changing their gut microbiome. Mice in this experiment received fecal transplants. Some mice received transplants from humans who have been diagnosed with ASD, while other mice received transplants from humans who did not have any diagnosis (control). This allowed researchers to control the composition of the gut microbiome in each mouse. They discovered that colonization with gut microbiota was enough to induce ASD-like behaviors in the mice. They also let the mice breed and collected gene expression data from the brains of their offspring to explore whether changing the gut microbiota could result in changed gene expression. In particular, they discovered that the offspring of mice who received stool from ASD donors showed different gene splicing and expression profiles of certain ASD-relevant genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that researchers are not suggesting that ASD is entirely induced by gut bacteria. There is a strong genetic component to ASD. Scientists have known for years that there are both genetic and environmental components to the development or severity of some ASD symptoms. This research explores one possible environmental component.\n\n\nYou can read the original research paper here.\n\n\n\nThe gut-brain axis is the term used for the proposed connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. In recent years, studies have identified links between neurological symptoms and the presence of intestinal inflammation. There are around 100 million neurons in the human gut, and around 70% of the serotonin (an important neurotransmitter) in the human body is made in the gut. Communication between the microbes in the gut and the brain happens through multiple routes, including immune signaling (signals sent to the brain by immune cells), stimulation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the enteric nervous system (a system of neurons in the intestinal that are often called the “second brain”) through formation of microbial-derived metabolites like tryptophan, short-chain fatty acids, or secondary bile acids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, the “up” arrow indicates an increase; this could be increased production of a protein, increased activity of a biological pathway, or a general increase in the presence of a structure. The “down” arrow indicates a decrease.\nResearchers have identified multiple ways the intestinal microbiota in the gut might remodel the structure of the nervous system. This includes changes in myelination, neurogenesis, neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity, growth of dendrites, activation of microglia, and changes in the permeability of the blood-brain-barrier. The exact mechanism for these changes is still unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy are the neural processes mentioned above important?\nmyelination: the process of forming protein sheaths (called myelin) around the long axons of nerves. This insulates the axon and improves the speed and efficiency of transmission of neural signals.\nneurogenesis: the formation of new neurons, particularly in the adult central nervous system. This is important for memory and learning.`\nsynaptic plasticity: the process of strengthening or weakening connections at the synapse of nerves (where the signal is transferred from one nerve to another). This sort of adaptive change is fundamental for memory and learning, but also helps with recovery after injury.\ndendritic growth: the process by which neurons form new branches (dendrites) and spines (small protrusions on the dendrites). This is a key aspect of synaptic plasticity and is essential for brain development, learning, and memory formation.\nmicroglia: immune cells found in the central nervous system. They support central nervous system development and synaptogenesis (formation of new synapses), maintain homeostasis, contribute to an immune response against infectious agents, and are associated with adult neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, degenerative diseases, stroke, trauma and regeneration.\nblood-brain-barrier: a highly selective semi-permeable barrier located in the central nervous system that separates the bloodstream from the fluid that surrounds the brain. It maintains a stable environment for neuronal function and regulates passage of molecules between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\n\nRemodeling of the nervous system via the gut microbiome is suspected to be responsible for the severity of some symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. A possible link between the gut microbiome and increased symptom severity is actively being studied for Major Depressive Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, fibromyalgia, migraines, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and more.\nThe samples in this dataset are from mice that do not carry genes associated with either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. Instead, any symptoms or changes in the brain they show are the result of microbes introduced to their gut via fecal transplant. This dataset gives you the opportunity to study possible effects of the gut-brain axis firsthand.\n\n\n\nThe data for this activity includes gene expression data from two different brain regions (striatum and prefrontal cortex) in mice. Additionally, there are two different types of mice. Some of the mice are an Autism Spectrum Disorder-type (see below for details), while others are control-type.\nBefore you start working with the dataset, you will need to make some decisions about the questions you want to answer.\nAre you interested in exploring gene expression differences between two regions of the mouse brain, without focusing on the gut-brain axis? Expand this section to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Structure: The Striatum and the Prefrontal Cortex\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset includes gene expression data from two different regions in the brain: the striatum and the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe striatum is part of the brain involved in motor control and cognitive tasks like reward processing, decision-making, and social interactions (often called executive functions). It lies deep within the center of the brain and is composed of both gray matter (which can be thought of as the “processing” part of brain tissue) and white matter (which is the brain structure involved in transporting messages); the combination of the gray and white matter give this region of the brain a striped appearance, resulting in the name “striatum”. The striatum is involved in both reflexive movement - that is, involuntary movement that happens as an immediate response to a stimulus - and slower, planned movement like walking. In Parkinson’s disease, some patients experience degeneration of parts of the striatum, resulting in spastic, uncontrollable movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is primarily in charge of decision making, reasoning, personality, maintaining social appropriateness, and other complex behaviors that fall under the umbrella of executive functions. This can include planning, self-control, and working towards long-term goals. The prefrontal cortex is located in the very front of the brain, just behind your forehead. One of the most famous brain injury patients was Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an iron rod through his forehead. His prefrontal cortex was destroyed in this accident, and doctors noted huge behavioral and personality changes. You can read more about his case here.\n\n\n\nAre you interested in exploring neurodevelopmental disorders? These are disorders that are the result of altered brain development. Although this dataset was created using “ASD-type” mice, many neurological disorders have shared symptoms and probably share a biological basis. Expand this section to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Disorders: Neurodevelopmental Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the following disorders can be diagnosed at any age, they are considered neurodevelopmental disorders because symptoms usually show up within the first two years of life. Many of these disorders have overlapping symptoms, including difficulty managing emotions, experiencing intense emotional outbursts, a dysregulated stress response system, difficulty with executive functions (like attention regulation, organization, and planning), and issues with social communication and unspoken social norms. Many of these disorders have similar biological roots, such as neuroinflammation, genetic variation, and disruptions in systems that rely on dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (which can cause impaired connections between regions of the brain, called white matter connectivity). People with these disorders also show differences in brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala compared to people without neurodevelopmental disorders. For example, malfunctioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is common in neurodevelopmental disorders. The HPA axis regulates the brain and body’s response to stress. Many people with neurodevelopmental disorders show an unusually strong reaction to stress and can have difficulty recovering from it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of all neurodevelopmental disorders - you may know of others that are not included! Any of these could be a good starting point for your research question.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological disorder that affects behavioral and social interactions, among other things. Individuals diagnosed with ASD can experience a wide range of symptoms, including differences in social behaviors and communication styles, as well as intellectual disabilities and physical issues like sensory sensitivities or gastrointestinal problems. Some genes that have been suggested as ASD risk genes include SHANK3, NRXN1, CHD8, ARIH2, ZDHHC15, and TRPC6. Individuals with ASD also show changes in both white and gray matter volume, as well as an imbalance in connectivity of neural circuits (there are more connections and stronger connections than typical within local regions of the brain, and both fewer and weaker connections between distant regions of the brain). The neural circuits that are imbalanced connect brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterized by difficulties with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Individuals may show predominantly inattention symptoms (predominantly inattentive ADHD), predominantly hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms (predominantly hyperactive ADHD), or a combination of all (combined type ADHD). Some proposed ADHD risk genes are SKI, ZNF544, ST3GAL3, and PEX2. Additionally, researchers believe alterations to the prefrontal cortex and the dopaminergic system are major contributing factors for ADHD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Disorders (LDs) include disorders such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. Each of these is characterized by difficulty developing a fundamental academic skill, including reading (dyslexia), math and working with numbers (dyscalculia), writing (dysgraphia), listening (auditory processing disorder), speaking (language processing disorder), or non-verbal reasoning (nonverbal learning disorder). Individuals with LDs frequently show differences neural connectivity within brain regions like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parietal lobes, which may contribute to decreased brain processing speed and executive functioning. Research also suggests that altered tryptophan metabolism is associated with LDs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMood Disorders are a group of disorders in which affected individuals exhibit emotional state changes, which can include episodes of deep sadness (dysphoria), lack of feeling anything (anhedonia), and extreme happiness or euphoria (hypomania or mania). The most well-known of these disorders are Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD). Some individuals with Schizoaffective Disorder or Schizophrenia (SCZ) also experience hallucinations and psychosis. Variation in serotonin transporter genes and dopamine receptor genes have been associated with Mood Disorders, as well as neurotransmitter alterations and brain circuit dysfunction, particularly within the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system (where the amygdala is).\nMood disorders like depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia are not currently listed as neurodevelopmental disorders in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

    "text": "Identifying genes of interest with the Mouse Genome Informatics database\nThe Mouse Genome Informatics database that tracks mouse genes and expression data. A full introduction to everything available through the MGI can be found here. We’ll reproduce some of it below.\n\nThe mouse as a model organism\nThe mouse is the most commonly-used model organism in laboratory work. In fact, mice and rats make up 95% of the lab animal population, and more than 80% of the research that has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine was done at least in part with mouse models [2], [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what makes mice such good model organisms for biomedical research? Well, first, they’re economical and relatively easy to keep. Since mice are small, they don’t require a huge amount of space or food. They also have fast reproductive cycles, so researchers can study multiple generations within only a few years. Most importantly, though, mice and humans are both mammals and have about 85% of their protein-coding genome in common. As a result, mouse physiology is quite similar to human physiology. The mouse circulatory, reproductive, digestive, hormonal, and nervous systems are frequently used as models to study how humans grow, age, and develop chronic diseases. They are particularly important model organisms for cancer research and neuroscience.\nYou can find additional information about how the mouse is used in research here!\n\n\nMouse gene IDs\nIn this dataset, genes are identified using their Ensembl Gene ID code. Every gene has an ID that looks something like this:\n\nENSMUSG00000000001\n\nENS stands for “Ensembl”. Ensembl is a genome database project managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute. It’s one of several databases like this. Others include NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; the organization that manages GenBank and PubMed) and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. When a gene code starts with “ENS”, it means you should look up the gene code in the Ensembl database.\nMUS stands for “Mus”, which is the genus for the mouse.\nG stands for “Gene”. When you see “G” in the ID name, you know you are working with a gene. There are also codes for transcripts (“T”), exons (“E”), and proteins (“P”).\n00000000001 is the numerical code associated with the gene.\n\n\nPicking your genes\nThe MGI allows you to look up information about genes you’re interested in but don’t know much about. This is particularly helpful if you are interested in genes that were identified in other research organisms or in previous studies. You could also start by looking up a human disease and associated human risk genes, then identify the homologous mouse genes.\nMake sure you are recording the name and gene ID for the mouse! Gene names are often similar between mice and humans, but the gene IDs will be very different. If you don’t use the correct gene ID when exploring this dataset, you won’t get very far.\nThere are multiple ways to use MGI to find information about your mouse genes.\n\nLooking up details on a mouse gene when you have the Ensembl gene ID\nOpen the Mouse Genome Informatics website. To look up information on a particular gene of interest, choose the “Genes” button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, type the gene ID into the “Search” bar up top. We’ll look up “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you type the gene ID into the Search bar and hit enter, you should see a new page with basic information about the gene. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Clicking on the blue squares takes you to a page with more information about how that particular gene was assigned to a pathway or molecular process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking up genes based on human gene name\nYou may have identified a human gene that you’re interested in for your project, so you need to figure out what the mouse ortholog is and (more importantly) what the mouse Ensembl ID is. Luckily, the MGI allows you to search based on the human gene name.\nLet’s say you’re interested in the human gene REG3A, pancreatic secretory protein that may be involved in cell proliferation or differentiation. It also is upregulated as a result of pancreatic inflammation.\nOpen the Mouse Genome Informatics website. To look up information on this human gene, type “REG3A” into the “Quick Search” bar and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that MGI returns 3 possible mouse genes that are orthologs to the human gene REG3A. This is totally normal! Remember, orthologs are gene that shares the same ancestry. In this case, there was likely a gene duplication event in the mouse ancestor after it split off from the human ancestor.\nYou can pick whichever ortholog you like (or even pick all of them). For this example, we’ll choose the mouse gene “Reg3a”. Click on the gene symbol (in this example, Reg3a) to get more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou might come across some unexpected terms when you search the MGI for your gene ID. In addition to genes, Ensembl gene IDs are also given to “pseudogenes”, “putative genes”, and “lncRNA”.\npseudogene: This is a stretch of DNA that looks like a gene but doesn’t actually code for any protein products. It’s essentially a copy of a gene that contains mutations that prevent translation into a protein product. The mutations can include partial deletions, missing promoters, missing start codons, premature stop codons, frameshift mutations, or missing introns. Any of these are enough to result in a pseudogene.\nputative gene: This is a DNA segment that is believed to be a gene, but its function and protein product has not been confirmed. They are frequently identified based on the presence of an Open Reading Frame. Putative genes are not given names until they become confirmed genes.\nlncRNA: This stands for “long non-coding RNA”. lncRNA is a type of RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but does not code for proteins. These RNA molecules are at least 200-500 nucleotides long and play roles in various biological processes, like gene regulation.\n\n\nOn the new page that you open, details about the gene are organized into familiar categories. But first, let’s take a look at the IDs on the right-hand side of the “summary” section. In particular, we’re interested in the NCBI link. Click this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re now on the NCBI page for the mouse gene Reg3a, which has the Ensembl ID for this gene. Copy this so you can later use it to look through the dataset!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn back to the MGI page on the Reg3a gene. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section. Clicking on the blue squares takes you to a page with more information about how that particular gene was assigned to a pathway or molecular process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly underneath the “ontology” section is information about when the gene is expressed during development. You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking up genes associated with a human disease\nYou may not know a particular gene that you want to explore in this dataset, but maybe you do have a human disease or condition that you’re interested in. You can look up mouse genes that might be associated with this disease in the MGI as your starting point.\nOpen the Mouse Genome Informatics website. Choose the tab that says “Human-Mouse: Disease Connection”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll then want to choose “Disease or Phenotype Name” from the drop-down menu on the left and type the disease of interest into the search bar on the right. For this example, let’s look up “pancreatic inflammation”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a brief pause (in which you may see graphics of a human and mouse running on wheels), a new page will open that lists human genes associated with pancreatic inflammation, as well as the mouse orthologs for those genes. This graphic will also indicate the molecular function these genes are associated with. You can click on any of the mouse genes to explore further. Let’s click on the top hit, Abcb1a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be on a page that contains all sorts of information about the mouse gene Abcb1a. In the “summary” section up top, you can click on the NCBI ID to get the Ensembl mouse ID for this gene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, you will find the Ensemble ID for the mouse gene Abcb1a under the “See Related” section. Copy this so you can later use it to look through the dataset!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn back to the MGI page on the Abcb1a gene. Down the left-hand side of the page, you will see sections about the chromosomal location, homology, gene ontology, expression data, and more. Most sections are expanded by default, but you’ll need to expand the “homology” section yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this section is expanded, you can find information about possible human homologs to the mouse gene, including alternate names and where the human homolog is located in the human genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you continue scrolling down the page, you can also examine the pathways and processes the gene product is involved in under the “gene ontology” section.

You can learn more information by clicking on the blue squares, or by clicking on the links in the upper right-hand corner. These links will take you to other websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have your genes of interest, you’re ready to start working with the dataset."

    "text": "Exploring the gene expression count data\nLet’s start by looking at a dataset that includes information on how many times each gene was expressed in a sample. This is the gene expression count dataset.\nThis dataset gives us an idea of the scale of gene expression - for example, which genes are expressed the most? Which genes are expressed the least? This is particularly useful when you want to know if a gene is usually turned on or off in a sample.\n\nPackage Install and Load\nWe will need to install the tidyverse package for this activity.\nType the following into the SciServer console and press return to run the code.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nNext, we will load the package so it’s ready to use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPackages are collections of R code, data, and documentation that extend the base functionality of R. Think of them like “expansion packs” on top of your basic R software.\nPackages are developed by the R community and made available through repositories like CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), Bioconductor, and GitHub. They are especially useful if you want to do a specialized kind of analysis, such as genomic analysis!\nWe use the library command to load and attach packages to the R environment. This means links the package you downloaded to your current session of R.\nThe “tidyverse” package that you loaded is useful for loading, wrangling, and exploring data.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the gene expression count data\nThe gene expression count data for this project is stored online. R has the ability to load datasets from URLs with the tidyverse’s read_csv command. Let’s load the gene expression count data for the samples that come from just the control-type mice. This contains all the prefrontal cortex and striatum samples taken from control-type mice (so, two brain regions, only one mouse type).\nRemember, R code always follows the same basic format! In this case, you are telling R to open the csv file that exists at a URL and save it as an object called “gutbrain_genes”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can load this dataset into R using this code.\n\ngutbrain_genes &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_counts_controls.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 59\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): GeneID\ndbl (58): SRR6652471, SRR6652507, SRR6652508, SRR6652511, SRR6652512, SRR665...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nRemember, R code always follows the same basic format! In this case, you are telling R to open the csv file that exists at a URL and save it as an object called “gutbrain_genes”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we load this dataset, we see it has 59 columns and 55,421 rows. Each row represents a gene. Each column is an individual mouse (sample), except for the first column (“GeneID”, which is the Ensembl gene IDs).\nHere are the URLs for the other gene expression count datasets for this project:\nOnly ASD-type mouse samples (contains both prefrontal cortex and striatum; two brain regions, only one mouse type): https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_counts_asd.csv\nOnly prefrontal cortex samples (contains both ASD-type and control-type mice; two mice types, only one brain region): https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_counts_prefrontalcortex.csv\nOnly striatum samples (contains both ASD-type and control-type mice; two mice types, only one brain region): https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_counts_striatum.csv\n\n\nExploring and summarizing count data\nWhen you first open the gene expression data, you want to verify that the data has loaded correctly. You can do this with the head and tail commands. Remember, head prints the first 6 rows of a dataset, while tail prints the last 6 rows.\n\nhead(gutbrain_genes)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 59\n  GeneID       SRR6652471 SRR6652507 SRR6652508 SRR6652511 SRR6652512 SRR6652513\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0        138\n2 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n3 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n4 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n5 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n6 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n# ℹ 52 more variables: SRR6652514 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652457 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652458 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652459 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652460 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652465 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652466 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652472 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652475 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652476 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652477 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652478 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652483 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652484 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652489 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652490 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652493 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652494 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652495 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652496 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652501 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652502 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652519 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652520 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652443 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652389 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652390 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\ntail(gutbrain_genes)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 59\n  GeneID       SRR6652471 SRR6652507 SRR6652508 SRR6652511 SRR6652512 SRR6652513\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG0000…          0          0          0          0          0          0\n2 ENSMUSG0000…      17809       4859      10099       9495      10105      11322\n3 ENSMUSG0000…       5384       1952       4737       4702       4385       3985\n4 ENSMUSG0000…      62645      30726      49800      57108      58010      35727\n5 ENSMUSG0000…        100        239         34        131          0        454\n6 ENSMUSG0000…       1510        537       2655       1769       2278       1810\n# ℹ 52 more variables: SRR6652514 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652457 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652458 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652459 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652460 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652465 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652466 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652472 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652475 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652476 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652477 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652478 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652483 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652484 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652489 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652490 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652493 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652494 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652495 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652496 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652501 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652502 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652519 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   SRR6652520 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652443 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652389 &lt;dbl&gt;, SRR6652390 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nYou may want to explore the distribution of your count data using summary.

\n\n\n\n\nPlotting histograms and dealing with zero counts\nA histogram is a good way to visually explore the distribution of the read counts, as well as get an idea of how many genes have few or no reads.\nBefore we make the histogram, we actually need to sum up the total reads for each gene (row). We can do this in R using the command rowSums. Remember, our dataset has 59 columns, but only columns 2 - 59 contain count data for each gene. The first column is the “GeneID”. So we need to tell R to do the row sum for columns 2-59, then save it as a new column called “total_counts”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngutbrain_genes$total_counts &lt;- rowSums(gutbrain_genes[2:59])\n\nNow we can make the histogram using the histogram command. Use a log10 scale on the x-axis to plot “total_counts”.\n\nhist(log10(gutbrain_genes$total_counts), main=\"Log10 Read Counts for Mouse RNA-seq sample\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may choose to deal with zero-count genes by adding 0.1 to each count before the log10 transformation.\n\ngutbrain_genes$total_counts_trans &lt;- gutbrain_genes$total_counts + 0.1\n\nhist(log10(gutbrain_genes$total_counts_trans), main=\"Transformed Log10 Read Counts for Mouse RNA-seq sample\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at read count for a single gene\nYou may want to look at the read count for a specific gene in your dataset. This can be done with the filter command. Let’s look at the read counts for the Reg3a gene, across all mice. Remember, this is the gene we looked up earlier in the MGI database. The Ensembl gene ID is “ENSMUSG00000079516”.\n\nfilter(gutbrain_genes, GeneID == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\")\n\n\n\nVisualize gene counts of multiple genes across groups\nWe can also look at the differential gene expression of a set of genes at once! This is usually done by creating a heatmap. In RNA-seq analyses, we usually put individual samples on the x-axis and normalized gene counts on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating heatmaps, we want to work with a dataset that includes normalized gene expression data for each gene. We loaded a dataset like this above that we called gutbrain_genes. If you don’t have an object in your environment called this, scroll back up to the “Loading the gene expression count data” section and run the code again.\nThe dataset you loaded has expression data for 55,421 different genes, which is too many to visualize. (You can try, but R will usually throw an error if you do.) In general, though, we are mostly interested in looking at the visualization of a particular group of genes, or a gene set.\nLet’s say we have identified 6 mouse genes that have been linked to the development of motor neurons. We’re interested in whether these genes show differential gene expression between the striatum and the prefrontal cortex. We can use the filter command to pull out normalized gene expression data for just these six genes.\nThese are the genes (with gene IDs) that we’re including in our gene set:\n\nSema3a: ENSMUSG00000028883\nMapk8: ENSMUSG00000021936\nNrcam: ENSMUSG00000020598\nDlg4: ENSMUSG00000020886\nSlit1: ENSMUSG00000025020\nCreb1: ENSMUSG00000025958\n\nFirst, create a vector that contains these gene IDs. (You can replace the gene IDs with the ones for your genes of interest, but make sure you use Ensembl gene IDs! They should all start with “ENSMUSG”.)\nEach gene ID should have quotation marks around it, and the different IDs should be separated using a comma.\n\ngene_set &lt;- c(\"ENSMUSG00000028883\", \"ENSMUSG00000021936\", \"ENSMUSG00000020598\", \"ENSMUSG00000020886\", \"ENSMUSG00000025020\", \"ENSMUSG00000025958\")\n\nNow we simply filter the gutbrain_genes dataset so that we only keep the rows for the gene IDs in our gene set. Remember, we want to use the filter command. The combination of filter and %in% tells R to only keep those rows in the gutbrain_genes dataset if the gene ID is also found in our gene list we made earlier.\n\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- filter(gutbrain_genes, gutbrain_genes$GeneID %in% gene_set)\n\nNow we have our data subsetted the way we want, but we aren’t quite ready for the heatmap yet. In order for R to make a heatmap from our data, we do have to reformat things a little bit. Right now our data is in “tibble” format, but we want it in a numerical “matrix” format. We can’t switch directly from “tibble” to “matrix” (because the GeneID column is character data, not numerical data). Instead, let’s first convert from “tibble” to a format called “dataframe”.\n\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- as.data.frame(gutbrain_motor)\n\nTo our eyes, not much has changed in the format, but it’s very different to R. Now we’re going to tell R to name the rows based on the “GeneID” column, and then delete the current “GeneID” column. We are also going to delete two columns we created earlier, “total_counts” and “total_counts_trans”.\n\nrownames(gutbrain_motor) &lt;- gutbrain_motor$GeneID\n\ngutbrain_motor$GeneID &lt;- NULL\n\ngutbrain_motor$total_counts &lt;- NULL\n\ngutbrain_motor$total_counts_trans &lt;- NULL\n\nGreat! Now we can change the format of gutbrain_motor_controls dataset to “matrix” format in order to make our heatmap using the heatmap function.\n\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- as.matrix(gutbrain_motor)\n\nheatmap(gutbrain_motor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you have just created a heatmap! The map itself is a series of stacked boxes. Each square within the heatmap represents the gene count for a particular gene in a particular sample. By default squares with the high gene counts are colored dark red. Squares with the lowest gene counts are colored pale yellow.\nBy default, R will order the samples (what we have on the x-axis across the bottom) in a way that clusters similar samples together. This is why we see columns of lighter yellow in the center of the heatmap, with darker orange and red columns on the edges. This suggests that there are groups of samples that have higher gene expression, but it’s hard to tell right now if these groups correspond to the prefrontal cortex vs striatum (which is what we’re interested in). It would be helpful if we could tell R to group based on prefrontal cortex vs striatum instead.\nLuckily, this is possible! Our dataset is already in the order we want (with all the prefrontal cortex samples first). We can just tell R to use the default ordering of the dataset instead of clustering and rearranging the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the samples in my dataset ordered?\n\n\n\nWhen these datasets were made, the samples were ordered in a specific way so that you could easily make your heatmaps.\nOnly control-type mouse samples (contains both prefrontal cortex and striatum; two brain regions, only one mouse type): prefrontal cortex samples first, then the striatum samples\nOnly ASD-type mouse samples (contains both prefrontal cortex and striatum; two brain regions, only one mouse type): prefrontal cortex samples first, then the striatum samples\nOnly prefrontal cortex samples (contains both ASD-type and control-type mice; two mice types, only one brain region): ASD-type samples first, then control-type samples\nOnly striatum samples (contains both ASD-type and control-type mice; two mice types, only one brain region): ASD-type samples first, then control-type samples\nBut if you ever want to verify the details for a particular sample, you can check out the metadata! This is the data (or information) about each of the samples. The metadata is stored at &lt;mouse_gutbrain_metadata.csv&gt;. You can load it into R using read_csv.\n\n\n\nheatmap(gutbrain_motor,  Colv = NA, Rowv = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect! Now we can easily see that four of our six genes seem to be expressed in lower levels by the samples on the right side of the heatmap (the striatum samples), while one gene is expressed in higher levels by the striatum. This is definitely intriguing!\nNotice that not all the striatum samples have the same expression for each gene. This is normal variation and could be due to actual difference in gene expression levels or be the result of laboratory methods.\nFinally, we can customize the heatmap by changing the color scheme and adding a title. As as example, we’re going to tell R to make a spectrum of colors between white and blue, with white indicating the lowest expression and blue indicating the highest expression, and 16 possible color categories.\nYou can find an extensive list of all the colors available in R at https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/awesome-list-of-657-r-color-names/. The general convention in biology is that the lightest colors on a heatmap indicate the lowest values.\n\nheatmap(gutbrain_motor,  Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, col = colorRampPalette(c(\"white\", \"darkblue\"))(16), main = \" Motor Neuron Gene List Expression\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, here’s all the code you just ran to create your heatmap in one place, in case you want to run it again.\n\n#define your geneset and make a vector\ngene_set &lt;- c(\"ENSMUSG00000028883\", \"ENSMUSG00000021936\", \"ENSMUSG00000020598\", \"ENSMUSG00000020886\", \"ENSMUSG00000025020\", \"ENSMUSG00000025958\")\n\n#create new dataset that only include expression data for your geneset\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- filter(gutbrain_genes, gutbrain_genes$GeneID %in% gene_set)\n\n#change format of dataset from \"tibble\" to \"matrix\"\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- as.data.frame(gutbrain_motor)\nrownames(gutbrain_motor) &lt;- gutbrain_motor$GeneID\ngutbrain_motor$GeneID &lt;- NULL\ngutbrain_motor$total_counts &lt;- NULL\ngutbrain_motor &lt;- as.matrix(gutbrain_motor)\n\n#create heatmap with custom colors and title\nheatmap(gutbrain_motor,  Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, col = colorRampPalette(c(\"white\", \"darkblue\"))(16), main = \" Motor Neuron Gene List Expression\")"

    "text": "Exploring the differential expression data\nNow let’s look a differential expression dataset, which compares gene expression counts between two groups. This dataset gives us an idea how the change in a gene’s expression might be associated with a disorder or a cell type. This is particularly useful for beginning to map the genetic drivers of a particular phenotype.\n\nPackage Install and Load\nBefore you start, make sure to load the tidyverse package! You should still have it installed from last time.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nLoading the differential expression data\nLet’s say you want to open the dataset that compares gene expression between ASD and control mice in both brain regions and call it asd_vs_c. We will do this using read_csv. Copy and paste this command into your console:\n\nasd_vs_c &lt;- read_csv(\"https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol.csv\")\n\nRows: 55421 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): gene\ndbl (6): baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nHere are the URLs for all the possible comparisons you can examine with this dataset:\nComparing gene expression between ASD and control mice\nBoth brain regions: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol.csv\nPrefrontal cortex only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_prefrontalcortex.csv\nStriatum only: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_autismVcontrol_in_striatum.csv\nComparing gene expression between prefrontal cortex and striatum\nAll mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype.csv\nOnly ASD mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype_in_ASDmice.csv\nOnly control mice: https://genomicseducation.org/data/mouse_gutbrain_de_tissuetype_in_controlmice.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich differential expression dataset should I use?\n\n\n\nEven though this dataset is from a single study, there are still lots of options for independent research questions. You have the option to look at gene expression in control-type vs ASD-type mice, as well as gene expression in both striatum and prefrontal cortex. All the mice were male and sacrificed at the same age (45 days).\nAdditionally, you can look at gene expression in striatum vs prefrontal cortex in only ASD-type mice or only control-type mice. Likewise, you also have the option of looking at gene expression in ASD and control mice, focusing only on striatum or only on prefrontal cortex.\nAre you mostly interested in how gene expression differs between the two brain regions? Are you interested in how neurons develop, or how groups of genes involved in movement might be expressed differently in two different regions? These sorts of questions are best to explore using striatum and prefrontal cortex comparisons.\nAre you really curious about differential expression in Autism Spectrum Disorder-type mice compared to control-type mice? Are you curious about potential associations between gene expression differences in known neurodevelopmental genes? These questions and others can be explored using the ASD-type mice and control-type mice comparisons.\n\n\n\n\nRanking the genes by log2FoldChange\nThe log2FoldChange value gives us an idea of which genes show the greatest differential expression between the ASD mice and the control mice. It is a log-transformed ratio of how many gene transcripts were found in ASD-type mice compared to control-type mice. We take the log2 of this ratio (the fold change) because it makes interpretation easier. Genes with no difference in expression between groups have log2FoldChange values close to zero. Negative log2FoldChange values means a decreased expression (or, a downregulation in gene expression) in the experimental group versus the control group. Positive log2FoldChange values indicate genes that are upregulated, or have increased expression in the experimental group versus the control group.\nWe can arrange the table based on these values (going from smallest to largest) by copying the following code into your console:\n\nasd_vs_c_ascending &lt;- arrange(asd_vs_c, log2FoldChange)\nhead(asd_vs_c_ascending)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  gene               baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000089657     16.9          -25.5  1.81 -14.1 2.18e-45 7.29e-41\n2 ENSMUSG00000102414     14.9          -25.4  1.89 -13.4 4.00e-41 3.81e-37\n3 ENSMUSG00000083812     14.6          -25.4  1.80 -14.1 3.82e-45 7.29e-41\n4 ENSMUSG00000074445     11.5          -25.0  1.89 -13.3 3.44e-40 2.62e-36\n5 ENSMUSG00000094151     11.2          -25.0  1.79 -14.0 2.97e-44 3.77e-40\n6 ENSMUSG00000053773     10.6          -24.9  1.99 -12.5 6.66e-36 4.23e-32\n\n\nThe genes at the top of this table have the most negative log2FoldChange values and are downregulated in ASD-type mice.\nWe can use a similar command to look at the genes with the largest positive log2FoldChange.

These types of plots have log2FoldChange on the x-axis and a log transformed padj on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will first need to do a log transformation of the padj variable. We do this in order to spread our values out along the y-axis - otherwise, all the dots that represent genes will be too scrunched together.\n\nasd_vs_c$padj_trans &lt;- -log10(asd_vs_c$padj)\n\nNow, we just create a scatterplot. The code for this is kind of complicated, so you will want to paste the code below into your console.\nHere’s the code for your basic volcano plot. data tells R what data to use, x tells R what the x-axis values should be, and y tells R what the y-axis values should be. Notice that we can just use the column names for x and y!\n\nggplot(data = asd_vs_c, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = padj_trans)) +\n         geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 17318 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also color code the genes (points) which are significantly upregulated or downregulated. In order to do this, we will need to create a new column in our dataset that identifies whether a gene is upregulated in ASD-type mice, downregulated in ASD-type mice, or has the same regulation in ASD-type mice compared to control-type mice.\nIn this new column, we can decide the thresholds that a log2FoldChange value must meet in order to be considered upregulated or downregulated. We will consider genes to be upregulated if the log2fold change is greater than 0.6 and downregulated if it is less than -0.6. You can change these thresholds to whatever makes sense for you.\n\nlog2foldchange is just a representation of a ratio, so the sign indicates the direction of regulation. It’s important to remember which group is your comparison group!\nFor example, if you are look at regulation in group A compared to group B, you might have a log2foldchange value of 1 (indicating the gene is expressed twice as much in A as it is in B).\nHowever, if you are looking at regulation in group B compared to group A, the log2foldchange value will be -1 (because the gene is expressed half as much in B as it is in A).\nThe comparison group matters with ratios!\n\nWe are also setting a significant p-value as less than 0.05 (but you can also change this based on your best judgment).\nWe start by creating a new column called diffexpressed and setting everything to “NO” (as in “no expression differences between ASD-type and control-type mice”). We then specify the genes for which this column should be changed to “UP” or “DOWN” (based on log2FoldChange and padj).\nTo recap: A gene is labeled “UP” if its log2FoldChange value is greater than 0.6 and its adjusted p-value is less than 0.05.\nA gene is labeled “DOWN” if its log2FoldChange value is less than -0.6 and its adjusted p-value is less than 0.05.\n\nasd_vs_c$diffexpressed &lt;- \"NO\"\n\nasd_vs_c$diffexpressed[asd_vs_c$log2FoldChange &gt; 0.6 & asd_vs_c$padj &lt; 0.05] &lt;- \"UP\"\n\nasd_vs_c$diffexpressed[asd_vs_c$log2FoldChange &lt; -0.6 & asd_vs_c$padj &lt; 0.05] &lt;- \"DOWN\"\n\nhead(asd_vs_c)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  gene          baseMean log2FoldChange lfcSE  stat   pvalue     padj padj_trans\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ENSMUSG00000…     16.9          -25.5  1.81 -14.1 2.18e-45 7.29e-41       40.1\n2 ENSMUSG00000…     14.6          -25.4  1.80 -14.1 3.82e-45 7.29e-41       40.1\n3 ENSMUSG00000…     11.2          -25.0  1.79 -14.0 2.97e-44 3.77e-40       39.4\n4 ENSMUSG00000…     14.9          -25.4  1.89 -13.4 4.00e-41 3.81e-37       36.4\n5 ENSMUSG00000…     11.5          -25.0  1.89 -13.3 3.44e-40 2.62e-36       35.6\n6 ENSMUSG00000…     10.6          -24.9  1.99 -12.5 6.66e-36 4.23e-32       31.4\n# ℹ 1 more variable: diffexpressed &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nOkay! We can now add some color to the volcano plot we made earlier. We do this by adding a line to our code that tells R to color the data points based on the diffexpressed column (col = diffexpressed). We also add a line about the colors we want to use (scale_color_manual). In this case, we have chosen to make the points for downregulated genes turquoise and the points for upregulated genes gold. The additional command labels just creates the labels on the legend.\nYou can find an extensive list of all the colors available in R at https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/awesome-list-of-657-r-color-names/.\n\nggplot(data = asd_vs_c, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = padj_trans, col = diffexpressed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"turquoise\", \"grey\", \"gold\"), \n  labels = c(\"Downregulated\", \"Not significant\", \"Upregulated\")) \n\nWarning: Removed 17318 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also label genes of interest in our plot. Let’s label the Reg3a gene (the same one we looked up in the MGI database), as well as Pcdh12 (or protocadherin 12). The two gene IDs we need to know are ENSMUSG00000079516 and ENSMUSG00000024440.\nWe will create another new column in our dataset. We will then tell R In this new column, the genes in our list (Reg3a and Pcdh12) are named, which everything else will have a missing name. When we remake the volcano plot, R will only label those points that do not have missing names in the gene_label column.\nThis is going to require a little bit of R trickery and something called a “case_when” statement.\nIn R, an “case_when” statement tells R to do something only when a condition is true. In our command, R is going through the asd_vs_c row by row. For each row, we are telling R to first check whether the geneID of that row is “ENSMUSG00000079516”. If it is, then R will fill in the gene_label column with the gene symbol “Reg3a”. If it is not, R moves onto the next part of our command.\nWhen R moves onto this second command, it’s now checking to see if the geneID for the row is “ENSMUSG00000024440”. If it is, then R fills in the gene_label column with the gene symbol “Pcdh12”. If it is not, R moves to the third command in the case_when statement. The final line tells R to fill in the gene_label column with “NA” for any row that didn’t match the previous commands. This will tell R in the future that the information for this column is missing.\n\nasd_vs_c$gene_label &lt;- case_when(\n  asd_vs_c$gene == \"ENSMUSG00000079516\" ~ \"Reg3a\",\n  asd_vs_c$gene == \"ENSMUSG00000024440\" ~ \"Pcdh12\",\n  TRUE ~ NA_character_\n)\n\nGreat!

    "section": "Part 1",
    "text": "Part 1\nIn Part 1, we’ll go over the background and data for this activity.\nMany human diseases are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. For most of these diseases, it can be difficult to predict what combination will lead to a person developing disease. Instead, physicians and researchers talk about the increased risk - essentially, we know what factors increase the likelihood of developing diseases, even if we can’t predict with 100% certainty whether someone might get sick.\n\nPolygenic Inheritance\nWhen we think about genetically-inherited diseases, we usually think about those where a single gene variant can cause disease. Most of the classic examples of genetic disease, like sickle cell anemia, Tay Sachs, or cystic fibrosis, are passed along via Mendelian inheritance. A mutation in a single gene is sometimes enough to disrupt normal protein synthesis and cellular processes, causing a person to become sick. For example, the large “V” in the image below indicate disease-causing variants for cystic fibrosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, most diseases, particularly common diseases, are not the result of a mutation to a single gene. Instead, they are the result of mutations to many different genes. Each mutation itself isn’t enough to cause problems, but when all of them show up together, the cellular processes aren’t able to function normally. This type of inheritance (when a trait is caused by a combination of mutations to many genes) is called polygenic inheritance. For example, coronary artery disease is complex. There are about 60 genomic variants across the genome that are more common in people with coronary artery disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolygenic traits are quite common, and they aren’t always diseases! Any trait that shows a range of phenotypes is likely to be the result of polygenic inheritance. Some of the more famous polygenic traits include height and skin color.\n\n\nPolygenic Risk Scores\nResearchers have developed something called a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) to estimate relative risk for a disease based on genetics. First, researchers gather genomic data from many people, dividing them into two groups: those with versus those without the disease. They compare these groups to find genetic differences. These differences are used in the PRS calculation.\nWe can look at all the variants a person might have, add them up, and then get an idea of whether they have more variants that contribute to a disease relative to how many protective variants they have.\nTypically, values greater than 1 mean that variant is more common in the disease group. Let’s imagine we are helping a patient determine their risk for coronary artery disease. Their score is 1.0234. We have to look at the score relative to others to determine the risk. This patient is in the 33rd percentile, meaning that they have higher risk than 33% of the people in the study population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Risk\n\n\n\nIt’s always important to remember that having a higher PRS does not guarantee someone will get a disease. Likewise, having a lower PRS does not guarantee someone is protected from a disease.\nA PRS is just a rough estimate based on what we know at the moment about the genetics that contribute to developing a disease. In many case, a high PRS will only increase a person’s overall risk for a disease by less than 5%.\nA PRS is only as good as the reference database for a particular disease or trait.\n\n\n\n\nGenomic Ancestry\nThe human genome contains a huge amount of variation. Different geographic regions have different frequencies of variants. By comparing individuals to others, an individual person’s variants can be used to determine the geographic region of their most likely ancestors. Several commercial companies perform these comparisons. Variants in the mitochondrial DNA are maternally inherited, variants in the Y chromosome are paternally inherited, and autosomal variants can come from either parent [1].\n\n\nExploring Variant Data\nIn the next steps, we’ll be looking at how PRS can help patients be more informed about disease risk.\nThis example will look at prostate carcinoma, or prostate cancer. While prostate cancer is common in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related death, it tends to be slow growing with limited aggressiveness [2]. This means that genetic screening and symptom monitoring, especially in older age, can have a big impact on outcomes.\n\n\nMr. J’s Data\nMr. J is a man living in Baltimore, and recently celebrated his 50th birthday. He is a history teacher with Baltimore City Schools and recently has been enjoying spending more time with his bowling league. One of his teammates let Mr. J know he won’t make it to practice on Friday because he’s getting a cancer screening. Curious, Mr. J asks how often that has to happen. He wonders if he needs to get screened. He learns that his teammate has been getting screened more often because of a family history of prostate cancer and genetic testing results.\nThe next time Mr. J goes to his doctor, he asks if he should get genetic testing done. His uncle had prostate cancer but he’s not sure if it has a genetic link.\nWe’re going to take gene screening data for Mr. J, to understand his risk. Mr. J has African ancestry, which will be important later. First, let’s explore a variant to learn more.\n\n\nExploring Variants\nLet’s explore the rs7463326 variant a bit more. Go to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/variants and type “rs7463326” in the search bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the first result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the variant information. The most severe rs7463326 variant lies in an intergenic region, or between protein coding genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to see the risk allele associated with the variant. For rs7463326, the risk allele is “G” and it’s associated with prostate carcinoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. J has a “G” here. Other patients might have “A” or “C”. This means he might be more at risk than other patients. However, we know risk is often dictated by multiple genes. In the next steps we’ll explore how to assess risk with multiple variants."

It should look like:\nrs7463326:G\nrs58235267:G\nrs74001374:C\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the data mean?\n\n\n\nEach line of the data represents a variant location in the genome and individual person’s version of that gene (allele).\nFor example, rs7463326 is the variant.

Then, click on “Apply Filters” to update the studies that can be used to calculate the PRS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder “Select from Filtered Studies”, type in the study number, “GCST011047”, or find it from the dropdown menu.

Variants should be collected from the same ancestral population as the patient. This is because some alleles are more rare in specific human ancestries and can confer different amount of risk / protection. Mr. J has African ancestry, so we should use a study whose participants also have African ancestry.\nMr. J’s variant data was carefully collected based on the variants identified in the Conti study (GCST011047).\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the Population\nSelect “African” as the “Preferred Super Population” and “1000 Genomes - AFR population” under “MAF Population”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, click “Calculate Risk Scores”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the Score\nThe calculated score for this study will appear in the box at the bottom.

Mr. J’s data was comprehensive and included all of the 19 variants described in the Conti study. We can feel confident that there is not a lot of missing data.\nPolygenic Risk Score: Risk estimate based on all of Mr. J’s variants. Because the score is greater than 1, generally that means some increased risk.\nPercentile: Risk described relative to others in the population. A percentile of 100 means that Mr. J has greater risk than almost everyone else! He has more of the disease causing variants compared to others in the population."

A percentile of 82 means that Mr. J has greater risk than 82% of other people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapturing More Variants\n\n\n\nA mismatch between the study population and the patient’s ancestry can create gaps in PRS analysis. Many early studies were performed on genomes of people of European ancestry. This means that more reliable data is present for people of European ancestry. In other words, their variants are better known. People of African or East Asian ancestry don’t always had variant data that is as comprehensive. This means it’s more likely to end up in the situation above, where we can’t reliably calculate PRS.\nScientists realized recently that this was a problem. Programs like All of Us aim to collect better data on people from diverse backgrounds to improve PRS. Technology improvements have also made it more affordable to screen for more variants."
